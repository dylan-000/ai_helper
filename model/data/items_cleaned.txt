TERRARIA ITEMS DATABASE
======================

=== Trapped Chests ===
Description: A Trapped Chest is a mechanical item that has the appearance of a normal chest. It cannot be used for storage, as it does not have any storage slots. When it is opened, it emits a signal and can be connected with wire. Any chest can be crafted into a Trapped Chest at the Heavy Work Bench with the desired chest and 10 wire. The Trapped Chest can be sold for 1. In the game code there exist 2 Unobtainable Trapped Chests: ItemName.Fake_newchest1 and ItemName.Fake_newchest2 (these names are the internal names, as proper names don't exist). They appear to be the initial versions of the Trapped Crystal Chest and Trapped Golden Chest, having remained in the game code when working versions of these trapped chests were, for some reason, later added to the game as different items (instead of fixing the initial ones). They can only be obtained through inventory editors and will not, unlike some Unobtainable items, automatically disappear from the inventory upon game startup. In the inventory they have the same appearance as the normal Trapped Chest, and when placed into the world they look exactly like the Crystal Chest and Golden Chest, respectively. They can be interacted using Smart Cursor, and will functions like normal Trapped Chest. The character and all items that were used in that moment freeze and all of their visible accessories and vanity armor will appear invisible when the Cursor is hovered over them once they are placed. The character completely stops (even in mid-air), but it can still change direction, and no items can be used. The character unfreezes and their accessories appear visible once the cursor is moved away from these chests. In addition, hovering the Cursor over these chests while the menu is open will crash the game. The game data also contain several unused Trapped Chest sprites[1]: a trapped version of every Locked Chest (see key), a Trapped Dead Man's Chest (that can't openVerify), a Trapped Barrel, and a Trapped Trash Can. Although Trapped Locked Chests need a key to be unlocked, they will still send a signal if the player tries to open one without having the appropriate key.Verify None of these chests have any item IDs, cannot be obtained even with inventory editors, and rather fit the category of Unimplemented items instead of Unobtainable.

=== Dungeon Brick Walls ===
Description: Dungeon Brick Walls are the background Walls found naturally-placed in Dungeons. There are a total of 9 different variants, but each Dungeon can include only the three wall types matching that Dungeon's bricks. A single Dungeon will usually contain all three types in different areas; in each area, the Faction Flags found will correspond to the wall variant. Dungeon Brick Walls can be crafted (and converted into Dungeon Bricks), and can be freed and collected with a Hammer or Dynamite after Skeletron has been defeated. As with other naturally-placed walls, natural Dungeon Brick Walls can only be mined from one of their edges (meaning that the wall tiles to be mined must be adjacent to empty tiles or player placed walls). As usual for natural walls, once they have been collected and placed by players, Dungeon Brick Walls will no longer count as natural; they will then prevent enemy spawns, and can be used for valid NPC Housing. However, they can be thrown into Shimmer to create Cursed Dungeon Brick Walls, which do count as natural walls and can spawn dungeon enemies. The type of Dungeon Brick Wall present in an area of the Dungeon, as well as the Faction Flags found there, will indicate which types of Hardmode Dungeon enemies are most likely to spawn there after defeating Plantera. Enemies matching the wall type have a ~90% chance to spawn, while other enemies have ~5% chance. Removing Faction Flags and/or placing them elsewhere will not affect enemy spawns; the natural flag placement is merely a hint, matching the background walls. As above, if any of the types is harvested and (re)placed by a player, it no longer counts as a natural wall, and will not spawn enemies at all.

=== Sandstone Walls ===
Description: Sandstone Walls are naturally-generating background walls found in the Underground Desert. Underground Deserts generate by default the normal Sandstone Wall which may be converted into Ebon-, Crim-, and Pearlsandstone Wall if exposed to the Corruption, Crimson, and Hallow, respectively. Converted Sandstone Walls may further spread conversion to other walls. See biome spread for more information. These walls can be destroyed with a hammer, but will drop nothing. These walls also do not stop enemies from spawning and cannot be used for proper housing. On the PC version, Console version, Mobile version, and tModLoader version, these walls can be crafted with their respective Sandstone types where they can be used like other craftable walls.

=== Jack 'O Lantern Launcher ===
Description: The Jack 'O Lantern Launcher is a Hardmode, post-Plantera launcher that fires Explosive Jack 'O Lanterns and drops from Pumpking during the Pumpkin Moon event. The player can buy Explosive Jack 'O Lanterns from the Arms Dealer for 15 each if they have the launcher in their inventory. The Jack 'O Lantern Launcher has a base 10% critical strike chance as opposed to the usual 4%. Its best modifier is Unreal.


=== Spiky Ball ===
Description: Spiky Balls are consumable ranged weapons that are primarily used as passive traps, by tossing them to the ground, where enemies who pass over them will take damage up to 7 times (after which the Spiky Balls vanish). If not destroyed, they will automatically vanish after 1 minute. They can also be directly thrown at enemies, but they have a very short arc and quickly fall to the ground. Spiky Balls are dropped by all goblins in the Goblin Army, and can be purchased from the Goblin Tinkerer for 80 each. The Goblin Tinkerer uses Spiky Balls to defend himself against nearby enemies.


=== Digging Molecart ===
Description: The Digging Molecart is a Minecart variant that automatically digs a tunnel and lays down Minecart Tracks. It is sold by the Zoologist for 50 once the Bestiary is 35% completed (189 entries). Once mounted on existing tracks, the Digging Molecart moves forward with a maximum speed of 31 mph, digging out a tunnel five tiles high and laying track as it goes. The cart will only move and place tracks horizontally, even if it is started on a diagonal slope.


=== Threads ===

=== Chairs ===
Description: Chairs are furniture items which can be placed on the ground. They count as a comfort item, which is one of the required elements in order to make a house suitable for an NPC. In combination with a Work Bench or a Table, they also form minor crafting stations. Players can sit in chairs by using ⚷ Interact on them and get a boost on health regeneration, similar to beds and sofas. NPCs can sit on chairs too. All chairs are 1 tile wide, 2 tiles high, and must be placed on top of a solid block or platform. Also see Throne, which also fulfills a house's comfort item requirement. Including the Throne and Bar Stool, there are 44 / 36 / 28 / 25 varieties of chairs.

=== Monoliths ===
Description: Monoliths are mechanisms that activate backgrounds and other screen effects normally seen during events. They can be toggled with the ⚷ Interact button, via wire, or by equipping them in the vanity slot. There are seven / four different monoliths: the Solar, Vortex, Nebula, Stardust, and Void Monoliths can be crafted, while the Blood Moon Monolith is dropped by the Dreadnautilus with a 11.11*1/9 (11.11%) chance, and the Aether Monolith is obtained after dropping an angel statue into Shimmer.

Description: The Sakura Sapling is a seed purchased from the Zoologist once the Bestiary is 30% complete (162 entries). When planted, it grows into a Sakura tree, which is a tree that can also spawn naturally in the forest. Its appearance is decorative and it functions identically to regular forest trees.


=== Soul of Might ===
Description: The Soul of Might is one of the six / seven souls. It is dropped by The Destroyer and also very rarely by Lepus, making it obtainable in pre-Hardmode on Windows Phone and 3DS. Crafting all items requires 53 / 32 / 102 Souls of Might, meaning the player must defeat The Destroyer 3–4 / 2–3 / 3–6 times.

=== Sand Blocks ===
Description: Sand Blocks are soil blocks found in vast quantities in Desert biomes and also forming the shore and bottom of Ocean biomes. Sand in these areas often extend far Underground, and can be found as microbiomes in patches in the Underground layer. Sand can spread and be converted by the evil biomes and The Hallow (see below). Sand is subject to gravity, a unique quality only shared by Slush, Silt, and Shell Piles. Sand Blocks will deal damage to any player or enemy they fall on. If the player is submerged in Sand blocks as a result, the Suffocation debuff will be inflicted until the player manages to escape. Sand is used to craft a small number of building blocks and other items directly, but it is also the raw material for Glass, which is used for a full furniture set and a variety of other items. Ebonsand, Crimsand, and Pearlsand are biome variants of Sand Blocks, corresponding to the Corruption, Crimson, and Hallow, respectively. They will replace regular Sand in their respective biomes, wherever they overlap with a Desert or Ocean biome. Like any other Corrupt, Crimson, or Hallowed block, after Hardmode begins, they will convert susceptible blocks (including regular Sand) that are up to three tiles away into their respective variants. These Sand variants are functionally identical to regular sand, but each variant can be used to craft a few biome-related items. They can be transformed back to normal Sand using Thrown Powder or Water, or the Clentaminator with Green Solution. Purification with the Clentaminator is not possible for falling Sand blocks. Any forms of Sand are ammunition for the Sandgun, but they cannot be stored in the ammo slots located next to the main inventory. Sand Blocks have an internal damage value of -1, reducing the Sandgun's effective damage by 1. The biome variants of Sand ammo also pierce enemies. Sand is similarly shot as Sand Ball projectiles by Antlions. Use of ammo-reduction buffs with the Sandgun allows easily "farming" sand; see Sandgun for details.

=== Sofas ===
Description: Sofas are vanity furniture items. There are currently 35 / 27 / 23Verify craftable sofas and 5 noncraftable sofas. All are functionally identical, and differ only in their appearance. Sofas count as a comfort item, which is one of the required elements in order to make a house for an NPC. Players can sit in sofas by pressing the ⚷ Interact button on them. Players can choose to sit on the left, middle, or right positions, and thus up to 3 players can sit on a sofa at a time. Sitting on sofas gives a boost to health regeneration, similar to chairs and beds.

=== KO Cannon ===
Description: The KO Cannon is a Hardmode melee weapon which has a 0.1*1/1000 (0.1%) chance to be dropped by any enemy or NPC during a Hardmode Blood Moon. It autofires a boxing glove projectile that is connected to the weapon's base by a short, thick chain. After striking a target or traveling 17 blocks, the glove retracts back into the weapon before being ready to fire again. Despite this weapon having a relatively short range, its higher knockback, base damage, and immunity to gravitational arcing makes it very strong at close quarters. The KO Cannon has no cooldown period; therefore its autofire rate is dependent only on the distance to its impact, meaning that an enemy or object in close range will cause a faster autofire rate. Its best modifier is Godly or Demonic. Both modifiers increase the average damage output by the same amount.


=== Potion of Return ===
Description: The Potion of Return is a potion that teleports the player back to their spawn point, similar to the Recall Potion, and additionally creates a portal exit at the location where the potion was consumed. A portal entrance will be created at the spawn point, which can be used to teleport back to where the player consumed the potion. The portal can only be used once and will disappear afterwards. In addition to being crafted, the Potion of Return can be found in Shadow Chests and Pots in the Underworld.

=== Critter Shampoo ===
Description: Critter Shampoo is a vanity accessory equipped in a social accessory slot that changes the color of summoned minions when paired with a dye in the corresponding dye slot. It is purchased from the Zoologist for 10 after completing at least 30% (162 entries) of the Bestiary.


=== Healing Potion ===
Description: The Healing Potion is a healing item that restores 100 health when used In addition to being crafted, Healing Potions can be found naturally in pots after Hardmode activation and pots in the Underworld before Hardmode. Several are also dropped by the Wall of Flesh, Deerclops and Skeletron. It is the second tier of healing potions, the first being the Lesser Healing Potion, the third being the Greater Healing Potion and the fourth being the Super Healing Potion.

=== Music Boxes ===
Description: The Music Box is a Hardmode accessory that is purchased from the Wizard for 10. When the Music Box is equipped in an accessory slot, it will record the currently playing game music after a randomized delay and alerts the player with a record soundhttps://terraria.fandom.com/wiki/File:Item_166.wav. This includes tracks being played by other Music Boxes. Once recorded, it will change into one of the Music Boxes listed below. A recorded Music Box can be played back in one of two ways: There are currently 88 / 42 / 34 different Music Boxes available. On the Nintendo 3DS version, the Music Box was made unobtainable because it was unstable. The same was true of pre-1.3.0.7 Mobile versions.

=== Paintings ===
Description: Paintings are decorative furniture items that can be placed on background walls. Each is a framed image that depicts a particular scene, usually Terraria-related. Their tooltips generally contain a person's name, apparently intended to credit each painting's artist; some names may be fictional, though some correspond to known Terraria sprite designers (see Trivia below). There are currently 173 paintings, 24 of which are sold by the Painter, 7 by the Princess, 4 by the Golfer, 1 by the Zoologist, 1 by the Clothier, 1 by the Truffle, and 22 are randomly sold by the Traveling Merchant. 32 paintings are found placed naturally in Underground Cabins, another 14 in the Underground Desert , 25 in the Dungeon, 12 in The Underworld, 6 from Floating Islands, 2 obtained by fishing, 1 from the Jungle Temple, 5 randomly acquired from Goodie Bags, 8 dropped by Solar Eclipse enemies, and 8 awarded randomly by the Angler for completing fishing quests.


=== Celestial Starboard ===
Description: The Celestial Starboard is an Expert Mode-exclusive wing-type accessory obtained from the Moon Lord's Treasure Bag. In addition to granting remarkable flight capabilities, it has both the hover function of the Hoverboard and Betsy's Wings (▼ Down key) and the upwards boost function of the Jetpack and Empress Wings (▲ Up key). At its top speed, it travels at 82 mph horizontal, 77 mph vertical, and 51 mph while falling.


=== Statues ===
Description: Statues are furniture items. There are a total of 116 different statues: 25 decoration statues, 36 text and numerical statues, and 55 functional mechanisms that have an effect when connected to wires and activated (26 hostile, 21 passive and 8 miscellaneous). Depending on the statue, upon activation, it may spawn enemies or critters, drop items, or teleport an NPC to the statue's location. Most statues can be found already placed in any area underground (most frequently in the Dungeon, Underground Cabins, and Cavern level), though Angel Statues also appear in chests. Like all furniture, a pickaxe is used to collect them. The 55 functional statues can be further categorised into 3 subtypes: 26 enemy statues, 21 critter statues and 8 other statues. These statues can be wired and activated to spawn enemies, drop items, or teleport a random NPC to their location. Statue-spawned enemies do not drop coins. Before the 1.4 update they generally would drop their other usual items at a reduced rate, with the exception of the Mimic, which does not drop any items whatsoever other than its banner, obtained after the designated amount of kills. Since the 1.4 update, this is only the case with certain statues. Aside from normal items, Slimes, Crabs, and Wall Creepers spawned from statues may also drop hearts and mana stars, potentially granting an alternative source of health and mana. Since the effects of the Life Drain and Vampire Knives work on spawned enemies, the player can build a pit with any timer spawning weak enemies to recover health during a boss fight. Statues found in Underground Cabins may be connected to Pressure Plates, and can easily spawn enemies that may kill early game players. See spawn limits (below) for limitations that apply to functional statues. Bomb, Heart, and Star Statues will not produce anything if there are already 10 of their item in the world, regardless of origin, or if 3 of their item is present within 16 tiles. Boulder Statues can only spawn a boulder every 15 seconds. Decorative statues have no function and only serve as decoration. They are generally found placed underground. The three Lihzahrd statues are only found in the Jungle Temple, and are the only statues that do not appear to be made of stone. The Angel Statue is sometimes found in chests. The Armor Statue can also be crafted with 50 at a Work Bench. On PC version, Console version, Mobile version, and tModLoader version, an Angel Statue can be thrown into shimmer to obtain the Aether Monolith. These are crafted at the Heavy Work Bench with 50 each. Activation of a spawning statue will not produce an item/character if a certain quantity of that entity already exists within a certain range. The range boundary is a circle, centered on the statue's spawning point. All statues (even those that appear shorter) have a footprint of 6 tiles (2 × 3). Each of these 6 tiles could be used as a wire input. Since the 1.3 update, each input shares the cooldown period with each other after activation. During an input's cooldown, activations from any trigger devices (Switches, Timers, Pressure Plates) will be ignored. For enemy and critter statues, this cooldown lasts exactly 0.5 seconds. Item statue inputs have a 10 second cooldown. Creatures spawned by Bunny, Fish, and Penguin Statues during a Blood Moon will immediately become corrupted. Corrupt Bunny, Corrupt Goldfish, and Corrupt Penguin (and their Crimson counterpart) enemies do not count against the spawn limits, allowing quicker farming. The same is true of Goldfish which start walking during rain, and Explosive Bunnies from Bunny Statues in For the worthy worlds. Another exception is the Bomb Statue, since Bombs may group together into stacks of up to 99 and each stack counts as a single entity. Bunny and Squirrel statues will spawn their usual critters in a Cavern town, not Gem Critters.


=== Butterflies ===
Description: Butterflies are small critters that can be found in Forests during daytime. They can be caught with a Bug Net and carried in the inventory, or crafted into Butterfly Jars. They can also be used as bait for fishing. The Underworld variant, Hell Butterfly, can be found in the Underworld during daytime.

=== Potted Trees ===
Description: Potted Trees are Hardmode decorative items purchased from the Dryad for 3 each.


=== Tables ===
Description: Tables are furniture items which can be placed on the ground, commonly used in conjunction with chairs. They count as a flat surface item, which is one of the required elements in order to make a house for an NPC. They can also form a crafting station when combined with a chair. There are 40 / 30 craftable tables, and 6 tables that must be looted from specific areas within the world. Some tables can also be found in Underground Cabins, in which they follow the theme of the cabin they are in.


=== Dog Whistle ===
Description: The Dog Whistle is a pet-summoning item that summons a Puppy pet. It can be dropped from Presents obtained during the Christmas event, with a chance of 0.24*29/12,000 (0.24%) in pre-Hardmode and 0.23*203/90,000 (0.23%) in Hardmode.


=== Doors ===
Description: Doors are furniture items that prevent enemies from entering an area when closed. Players can open them by pressing the ⚷ Interact on them. Doors can be placed in any space so long as it is exactly three blocks high, with ceiling and floor blocks. Friendly NPCs will open and close doors during the day as they wander about. Enemies that follow the Fighter AI can open doors, with a few exceptions. Additionally, Goblin Peons can remove doors entirely on contact, while Angry Bones and Butchers can open them with one hit. Doors can also be opened and closed via Wires. If you put wire on the door's hinge, then the wiring will toggle the door's closed/open state upon activation, but if you put wires on the side tiles, where the door opens, then the wiring will only close the door. The Lihzahrd Door occurs naturally at the entrance to the Jungle Temple, and initially requires a Temple Key to open. Once unlocked, it can be freed with a pickaxe or drill, and placed again by the player like any other door. Lihzahrd Doors can also be crafted, but their crafting station can only be obtained after opening the initial door, and the ingredients require the Picksaw (or better) to mine, which is dropped by Golem. Destroying the blocks either above or below a locked Lihzahrd Door does not destroy it. Apart from the standard doors listed here, there also exist Trap Doors and Tall Gates, which behave similarly. Every block in the game can also be used like a (Switch-toggled) door via Actuators. There are currently 39 / 30 / 22 / 19 craftable and 6 noncraftable types of doors which must be looted from various locations in the world.

=== Magic Missile ===
Description: The Magic Missile is a magic weapon that can be found in the Dungeon's locked Gold Chests. It can also be found in Golden Lock Boxes found in Dungeon and Stockade Crates which are fished up in the Dungeon. It fires an exploding projectile that can be controlled by holding the ⚒ Use / Attack button and moving the cursor. If the ⚒ Use / Attack button is released mid-drag, the missile will be flung in that direction. If the cursor is stationary on release, it flies directly away from the player. The projectile also emits a moderate amount of light. If any enemies are nearby when the missile is released, the missile will home in and attack them. Its best modifier is Mythical.

=== Dressers ===
Description: The Dresser is a piece of decorative furniture and a storage item. It will also fulfill a house's "flat surface item" requirement, and a Bottle can be placed on top of it to function as a crafting station for potions. Currently, there are 35 / 27 craftable versions, and 5 noncraftable versions which must be looted from various locations in the world. Hovering over the top half of a dresser displays a small dresser icon (or, if it was renamed, its name). Pressing the ⚷ Interact button there opens the dresser like a chest, with the same amount of storage space and ability to be renamed. Hovering over the bottom half of a dresser displays a small shirt icon (or, if it was renamed, its name in front of the shirt icon). Pressing the ⚷ Interact button there opens a prompt that allows the player to recolor their default clothing. This interface contains separate hue, saturation, and lightness settings for each of four character body sections: torso, sleeves, pants, and footwear. The coloration only applies to the player's default clothing; in order to recolor armor, accessories or vanity items, dyes must be used instead. Clothes can be changed repeatedly and limitlessly at no cost. This interface can be used to change one's default clothing between the options available at character creation by clicking on the character in the tall box.

=== Corrupt Grass Wall ===
Description: Corrupt Grass Wall is a type of Wall. Like the Grass of The Corruption, it is a dark hue of purple. On the PC version, Console version, Mobile version, and tModLoader version, it is sold by the Dryad during a Blood Moon. In all other versions, it can be destroyed, but not harvested, making it unobtainable as an item. Corrupt Grass Walls cannot be created by the player on the Old-gen console version, Windows Phone version, Old Chinese version, Nintendo 3DS version, and tModLoader 1.3-Legacy version like most other walls, but it can be converted from Grass Walls, Flower Walls, and Jungle Walls (both natural and those bought from the Dryad) by using Purple Solution sprayed with the Clentaminator, or throwing Unholy Water. As the Clentaminator affects a rather large area, creating areas of localized Corrupt Grass Walls without converting blocks and other wall parts may be difficult, making throwing Unholy Water more viable. Corrupt Grass Walls can spread The Corruption to nearby pure walls. See Biome spread for further information.


=== Invisibility Potion ===
Description: An Invisibility Potion is a buff potion that grants the Invisibility buff when consumed, which turns the player invisible. This lasts for 3 minutes / 2 minutes, but can be canceled at any time by right-clicking the icon ( ), by selecting the icon and canceling it in the equipment menu ( ), by double-tapping the buff icon ( ), or by canceling the buff from the buffs screen (). Using an Invisibility Potion conceals the player entirely, including their armor and vanity items, as well as the player's mount. While hidden, the player's Aggro statistic is reduced, meaning enemies will be less likely to target the player and they will not fire ranged attacks as long the player remains hidden. Attacking while under the stealth effect will cause the player to reappear temporarily, and the buff will be cancelled entirely if the player takes damage. Placing or breaking blocks will also cause the player to reappear. The player's head will still be visible on the minimap to non-hostile players in multiplayer. Using the potions also reduces enemy spawn rates by 20%. Using the Invisibility Potion will cause the player's sprite to turn invisible, though accessories and armor will remain visible. A player in default clothing, either through unequipping all items or through use of the Familiar set, will become totally invisible. This has no effect on enemies, but an opposing player in PvP will not be able to see an invisible player with no visible items equipped. However, competing PvP players still see an invisible player's name tag. Invisibility will never hide wings while flying, nor any lighting or particle effects from armor and other items. For example, the smoke effects from sprinting accessories, and beetles from Beetle armor, will still display. Minions, pets and light pets will also remain visible.

=== Shoe Spikes ===
Description: The Shoe Spikes are an accessory that lets players partially "stick" to the sides of blocks, slowly sliding down them when moving against them in midair. Jumps can also be performed off the sides of blocks. By repeatedly sticking and jumping, vertical blocks can be scaled. When sliding down, the slide speed can be accelerated using the ▼ Down key. Shoe Spikes can be found in Gold Chests underground and in Rich Mahogany Chests found in the underground jungle. Shoe Spikes function identically to the Climbing Claws, but are found in different locations, Climbing Claws only appearing in surface chests. When both Shoe Spikes and Climbing Claws are equipped simultaneously, the wearer remains completely "stuck" at a fixed point when moving against the sides of blocks, and may slide down with the ▼ Down key. This effect can be achieved using a single accessory if the Shoe Spikes and Climbing Claws are combined into the Tiger Climbing Gear at a Tinkerer's Workshop.

=== Chlorophyte Partisan ===
Description: The Chlorophyte Partisan is a Hardmode spear crafted using Chlorophyte Bars. It beats all of the "standard" ore spears, dealing 1 more damage than the best of the standard Hardmode ore spears, the Titanium Trident. When thrust, it emits a cloud of spores from the tip of the spear at the apex of the thrust, which looks exactly the same as the Chlorophyte Saber's projectile. The cloud travels a short distance in the direction the spear was thrust before fading out, and it is able to penetrate through solid blocks and multiple enemies, but it does not inflict any knockback. Its best modifier is Godly or Demonic. Both modifiers increase the average damage output by the same amount.

=== Kites ===
Description: Kites are miscellaneous novelty items that can be held by the player. A kite can be flown during windy days or if the player runs fast enough while holding it. It can be raised higher with ⚒ Use / Attack and lowered with ⚷ Interact. Lowering a kite back to the player will make them put it away. There are currently 24 kites found in game, either dropped by certain enemies on windy days or purchased from NPCs. Kites that are obtained from enemies can only be dropped on Windy Days.


=== Flarefin Koi ===
Description: Flarefin Koi are a type of pre-Hardmode () / Hardmode () fish which are found very rarely by fishing in any biome in any layer, but only in lava. They are used to craft Seafood Dinners and Inferno Potions.

=== Banners (enemy) ===
Description: Enemy banners are functional furniture items that can be placed on the underside of blocks. They are dropped by most enemies and a few critters. On the PC version, Console version, Mobile version, Old Chinese version, tModLoader version, and tModLoader 1.3-Legacy version, when placed, enemy banners provide a buff to any players standing within a rectangular area of 169×125[1] () / 100×84 () tiles centered on the banner. The buff grants players +50%/+100% damage inflicted with all damage to the corresponding enemy and −25%/−50% damage taken from attacks by the enemy. On the PC version, Console version, Mobile version, and tModLoader version, the banner of Old One's Army enemies will apply a weaker banner buff to the respective enemy, granting the players +10%/+20% damage inflicted and −5%/−10% damage taken.[2] Multiple banners of the same type will not grant stacked buffs. Multiple different banner types in the vicinity will however all take effect, and consolidate into a single buff icon. There are a total of 300 enemy banners: 122 pre-Hardmode, 171 Hardmode, and 7 unobtainable. Out of these, 117 belong to event enemies (28 pre-Hardmode and 89 Hardmode) and 12 to Old-gen console, Windows Phone, and 3DS-exclusive enemy variants (7 pre-Hardmode and 5 Hardmode). Since banners affect base damage rather than the calculation after defense is taken into account[4], 10 final damage does not just become 15 or 20 damage but can vary greatly. This also applies to other player and weapon damage modifiers but not player damage reduction ones. The real effect of banners grows the bigger the values are as well as how close Base Damage and Damage Reduction are. The lower and further apart, the closer the effect is to the original values. As an example for Expert Mode, Weapon Damage 50 and Enemy Defense 80 (40 Damage Reduction): For Normal Mode, same values: Example for damage dealt to the player, Expert Mode, 100 Damage, Player Defense 80 (60 Damage Reduction): In normal Mode, Enemy Base Damage is usually halved, Player Defense 80 (40 Damage Reduction): High Damage Example, fictional since no melee attack hits as hard as a Pirate Captain's Cannon Ball: 400 Damage, Titanium Armor 49 Defense (36.75 Damage Reduction). Original Damage 363.25. Upping the Player Defense by 24 to 73 (54.75 Damage Reduction). 345.25 Original Damage. The effect in Expert can easily grow to the point where one can kill a Wyvern in one or two multi-hits with a banner when one had to previously dance with it (10+ hits) and the very same weapon.

=== Throwing Knife ===
Description: Throwing Knives are consumable ranged weapons that can pierce up to two enemies. They can be purchased from the Merchant during a Blood Moon for 50 each and may also be found in Chests. Throwing Knives are greatly affected by gravity and arc similarly to Shurikens and Bones. They have the greatest range of these consumable ranged weapons (with Bones having the least). Throwing Knives have a 50*1/2 (50%) chance of being retrievable after use, even after hitting enemies. The Merchant will use Throwing Knives to defend himself against nearby enemies.

=== Pianos ===
Description: The Piano is a decorative furniture item. It counts as a flat surface item for the purpose of building a house. Bottles, Pink Vases, and Mugs can be placed on it and used as a Placed Bottle for crafting potions. There are currently 34 / 27 / 15 / 10 craftable pianos, and 5 non-craftable pianos that can be found in the Dungeon, Ruined houses and Pirate Invasion event. Some pianos can also be found in Underground Cabins, in which they follow the theme of the cabin that they are found in.

=== Buccaneer set ===
Description: The Buccaneer set is a Vanity Items set made up of the Buccaneer Bandana, the Buccaneer Tunic and the Buccaneer Pantaloons. These items are to be equipped in the Social Slots as they only provide a visual appearance. They can be obtained as a rare drop from any Pirate Invasion enemy, except the Pirate Captain and Parrots.


=== Hooks ===
Description: Hooks are a class of tools which aid the player in traversing terrain. When used, hooks fire a chain that latches to a surface or platform and pulls the player towards it. A hook is an essential tool which offers significant freedom from terrain height restrictions as well as being a fast movement option, and will often be the first major mobility tool a player acquires. A variety of hooks are available at all stages of the game (see table below). The Grapple hotkey activates the equipped hook in the player's equipment slot, or the first hook from the inventory (read from left→right, top→bottom) without requiring it to be in the player's hotbar. Several higher-tier hooks, like the Ivy Whip, allow the player to grapple multiple surfaces simultaneously. If the character grapples one surface, then fires the hook a second time, another chain extends from the player without dislodging the first. Upon grappling a second surface, the player will be suspended in midair at a point midway between the two surfaces. This allows players more freedom during construction, or for navigating hazardous areas, such as above lava or Meteorite. All Journey Mode characters will spawn with the basic Grappling Hook already in their inventory. When the player first acquires a hook, a small tutorial box will pop up telling the player how to use it. Hooks vary in range, velocity, number of deployable hooks, and number of hooks that can remain latched simultaneously.


=== Lanterns ===
Description: Lanterns are small light sources that hang from ceilings (the underside of blocks). They occupy less room than a chandelier, making them ideal for smaller spaces. Most lanterns can be toggled on and off via wire. There are two lanterns that provide regeneration buffs, the Heart Lantern and the Star in a Bottle, which grant health and mana regeneration, respectively. Toggling these lanterns off will only deactivate the light source, but not the buff. The Skull Lantern and Jack 'O Lantern, while having lantern in their name, are not like the rest of the lanterns in that they need to be placed on a flat surface. The Large Dynasty Lantern is considered a chandelier due to its dimensions.

=== Gemcorns ===
Description: Gemcorns are a type of seed whose saplings grow into Gem Trees, and can be crafted from an Acorn and any Gem. Natural Gem Trees can be found in the Underground and Cavern layer, although they are rare. Generally speaking, chopping down a Gem Tree will yield 7-48 Stone Blocks, 0-11 Gemcorns of the tree's type, and 0-24 Gems of the tree's type (each tile of the tree has a 10*1/10 (10%) chance of dropping a gem, otherwise dropping 1-2 Stone Blocks, and every non-barren leaf/branch tile additionally has a 50*1/2 (50%) chance to drop another Gemcorn[1]. See Growth section for detailed info.) The minimum requirements for a Gem Tree to grow is for it to be planted on one of two immediately adjacent Stone, Moss, or any of their biome variants at the Underground or Cavern layer, displayed by the Depth Meter. Light levels do not affect the growth of Gemcorns at all, therefore light sources can be placed nearby to help the player see better. However, placed torches will prevent tree growth, so do not place any torches within two tiles to the left and right of the sapling. Once a sapling is placed, it cannot be picked back up. To reduce enemy spawning in a Gem Tree farm, it is possible to place background walls in almost all of the background, except the two tiles occupied by the placed Gemcorn. Some underground enemies (and critters) will still spawn, but far fewer than with an un-walled farm. Gemcorns can grow in front of fences like other trees. They can also grow in front of natural walls. Of course, natural walls will allow enemy spawning as usual. The Gemcorns must be planted with three tiles of space between saplings for both to be able to grow. Gemcorn saplings need at least 11 blocks of open space above them, but 16 is better, and 17 will avoid the topmost leaves clipping into the ceiling. The tree size is determined every time the sapling attempts to grow, and if there are fewer than 16 blocks the attempt might fail. Thus, having fewer than 16 blocks available will effectively slow down growth, and will produce only shorter trees (which will yield fewer gems)[2]. Gem trees can be 7-12 tiles high (not counting space taken up by the non-tile "leaves" at the top) consisting of 6-11 "trunk" tiles topped by one "leaf" tile, with up to 2 additional "trunk" tiles at either side at the bottom, and 0-10 (depending on tree height) "branch" tiles off of the trunk (one tile per branch), totaling between 6-13 "trunk" tiles, 1 "leaf" tile, and 0-10 "branch" tiles. "Trunk", "leaf", and "branch" tiles drop either 1 Gem (10% chance) or 1-2 Stone Blocks (remaining 90% chance). "Leaf" and "branch" tiles also drop 1 Gemcorn 50% of the time if the leaf/branch tile is not barren (barren branches/leaves are fully colored stony gray, containing no visible "gem leaves"). If they are barren, they will drop nothing. Incidentally, branches have a 33.33*1/3 (33.33%) chance to be barren, and leaves have a 7.69*1/13 (7.69%) chance to be barren.

=== Rabbit Perch ===
Description: The Rabbit Perch is a vanity helmet sold by the Zoologist for 15 after the Bestiary is 40% complete. Although the item appears to be a hat with rabbit ears, equipping it will show an animated rabbit on the player's head.


=== Luminite Hammers ===
Description: Luminite Hammers are four tools. The four types are the Solar Flare Hammer, Vortex Hammer, Nebula Hammer, and the Stardust Hammer, each themed after a different Celestial Tower. They are all unable to be crafted, and instead the player must craft the Luminite Hamaxes.


=== Life Crystal Boulder ===
Description: The Life Crystal Boulder is a 2x2 furniture item that appears identical to the Life Crystal when placed. Life Crystal Boulders spawn naturally in No Traps and Get fixed boi secret seeds. Life Crystal Boulders are stationary when placed. When unsupported, they fall and begin to roll away. They pick up speed and damage players, enemies and NPCs along their path. Boulders will also begin to roll if mined with a pickaxe or drill. Life Crystal Boulders will roll across flat surfaces and down slopes, but will break into a Life Crystal that can be picked up on contact with an obstacle. They deal 120–160 / 240–320 / 360–480 damage to players (60–80 damage to NPCs, enemies, and critters) on contact. Life Crystal Boulders pierce through an unlimited number of entities.

=== Trophies ===
Description: Trophies are decorative furniture items which usually have a 10*1/10 (10%) chance to be dropped from most bosses. While they can be considered the "boss version of banners", they are purely cosmetic and do not provide any bonuses. Some trophies can only be rewarded by the Angler for completing fishing quests. In total, there are 34 / 30 / 24 trophies. Trophies from the Pumpkin Moon can only be dropped in wave 15 (10+) and have a drop chance of 100%. Trophies from the Frost Moon can only be dropped after completing wave 14 (7) and their drop chance increases with every wave, from 4.17% (6.25%) up to 12.5% (100%). Fishing trophies are rewarded randomly by the Angler NPC for completing quests.


=== Dyes ===
Description: Dyes are items that can be placed in the "Dye Slots" of a player's inventory to alter the colors and/or textures of equipped armor, vanity items, and accessories. The Dye Trader NPC sells two dyes (Silver Dye and Brown Dye) as well as the Dye Vat (5). The other dyes must be crafted using the Dye Vat or obtained through trading in Strange Plants to the Dye Trader. Primary crafted dyes can be further combined to craft shade, gradient, and patterned dyes. There are currently 119 / 116 / 68 different dyes in the game (118 / 115 / 67 on single-player worlds, as Team Dye is not available in single-player worlds). Some dyes will make sprites visible in complete darkness, most of which are Strange Dyes. Dyes are not available on the Nintendo 3DS version, due to the unavailability of pixel shaders. All basic dyes are crafted at the Dye Vat. Their crafting ingredients (not including Silver Dye and Brown Dye) can be found growing as background objects in the natural world or are guaranteed drops from special enemies. All dye plants show on the map. None of the Basic Dyes are visible in complete darkness. All colored basic dyes (except for black) can be combined with Silver Dye to craft Bright Dyes at the Dye Vat. None of the Bright Dyes are visible in complete darkness. These dyes produce fade effects between multiple colors. They are crafted at the Dye Vat. None of the Gradient Dyes are visible in complete darkness. These dyes form patterns with multiple colors, applied as separate blocks depending on the shape of the item. All colored basic dyes, and some "flame" gradient dyes, can be combined with Black or Silver Dye to craft "<Color> and Black Dye" or "<Color> and Silver Dye", respectively. They are crafted at the Dye Vat. None of the Compound Dyes are visible in complete darkness. These dye are given as quest rewards by the Dye Trader in exchange for Strange Plants. Dyes with a rarity level of Orange or Cyan can only be awarded in a Hardmode world even if strange plants are somehow obtained in pre-hardmode. Note that Strange Plants only begin growing in Hardmode. Strange Dyes have varying degrees of visibility in complete darkness.


=== Grandfather Clocks ===
Description: Grandfather Clocks are furniture items which provide information about the in-game time. If a player is nearby a Grandfather Clock (about 80 tiles horizontally and 50 tiles vertically), the time is displayed on the right side of the screen, underneath the minimap. The time is rounded to the last hour, similar to Tin and Copper Watches, but pressing ⚷ Interact on it will show precise time in minutes as a status message on the bottom left corner. There are 36 / 28 / 21 / 5 craftable versions and 5 / 2 noncraftable (but still lootable) versions. The regular Grandfather Clock can rarely be found in Underground Cabins. All are functionally identical, and differ only in their appearance.

Description: Bookcases are crafting stations used for the creating of three Hardmode Magic Weapons: Crystal Storm, Cursed Flames and Golden Shower. Bookcases can also be used as decorative Furniture, and fulfill a House's Flat Surface Item requirement. A Bottle (or similar) can be placed on one and used as a Placed Bottle for crafting Potions. There are currently 35 craftable Bookcases, and 6 versions looted from the environment: 1 from the Underworld, 4 from the Dungeon, and 1 from the Pirate Invasion. Some bookcases can also be found in Underground Cabins; their style follows the theme of the cabin where they are found.

=== Wooden Arrow ===
Description: Wooden Arrows are the most basic type of arrow. They can be used as ammunition for all types of bows and are also the base of the crafting recipes for several more powerful arrow types. Wooden Arrows can be crafted, found in Pots and chests, dropped by Pincushion Zombies, and can be purchased from the Merchant for 5 each. They can also be purchased from the Skeleton Merchant for 5 during moon phases 3, 4, 7, and 8. A fired Wooden Arrow has a 33.33*1/3 (33.33%) chance of being recoverable after hitting an enemy or a block (only when shot from a weapon that fires one arrow at a time). When shot with certain bows, regular Wooden Arrows will transform into another special projectile (such as the Molten Fury, which will transform them into a version of Flaming Arrows). Some other bows, such as the Pulse Bow, convert any type of arrow to their special variant.

=== Band of Regeneration ===
Description: The Band of Regeneration is an accessory that can be found in Gold Chests in the Underground and Cavern biomes and in Living Mahogany Trees in the Underground Jungle. When equipped, it regenerates 1 / 0.5 health every second. This effect stacks with the player's natural health regeneration, but unlike the natural regeneration, does not slow or stop when the player is moving or being attacked.

=== Living Fire Blocks ===
Description: Living Fire Blocks are animated background furniture blocks that, when placed, resemble small animated flames and emit faint orange light. They deal no damage on contact and can be freed with any pickaxe or drill. Living Fire Blocks have a 2*1/50 (2%) chance of being dropped by any enemy killed in the Underworld during Hardmode, including the Wall of Flesh, and drop in stacks of 20–50 at a time. While Living Fire Blocks can be placed in a manner similar to traditional, foreground blocks, they are actually in the background, similar to furniture, allowing the player to walk directly through them. They can attach to each other horizontally as well as vertically, but other traditional, foreground block types will not attach to them. There are five color variations of the base Living Fire Block, all of which are crafted from it. They are functionally identical.

=== Dragonflies ===
Description: Dragonflies are small, rare critters that can be found near large bodies of water which have sufficient amounts of cattails on the surface of the water during the day when it is not raining and there is low wind speed, outside of Towns. Near Towns they only spawn when it is raining and there is low wind speed. When approached, they will fly a short distance up and away from the player. They can be caught with any Bug Net and carried in the inventory. Dragonflies also serve as bait, with a Bait Power of 20%. They can be used to craft Dragonfly Jars. Unlike many critters, dragonflies are capable of spawning on screen. Dragonflies spawn in air within a small radius of cattails. If looking to farm dragonflies, it is advised to make space for more cattails to grow, since the critter appears to spawn directly from the cattail itself rather than by normal mob spawning. If there is air space underneath a submerged cattail, it is possible for the dragonfly to spawn in said air space. The type of dragonfly spawned is determined by the type of cattail. Oasis cattails spawn the Black, Orange and Yellow variants, whereas Forest cattails spawn the Blue, Green and Red variants.

=== Cool Whip ===
Description: The Cool Whip is a Hardmode whip that, upon striking an enemy, creates a temporary snowflake projectile that chases nearby enemies, dealing 15 damage to them on contact. The summoned snowflake ignores 30 enemy defense and is not affected by damage bonuses outside of banners. If a snowflake is already summoned, attacking with the whip will reset its timer instead of creating a new one. Like other whips, it causes minions to focus on the last-struck enemy. It also inflicts the Frostburn debuff for 4 seconds. Its best modifier is Legendary.

=== Stardust Fragment ===
Description: The Stardust Fragment is a Hardmode, post-Lunatic Cultist crafting material. It is one of the four Lunar Fragments, dropped from the Stardust Pillar during the Lunar Events in stacks of 12–60 / 24–100. Stardust Fragments can be used to craft Stardust armor, an end-game armor set that benefits all types of summon weapons, as well as Stardust-themed tools, weapons, wings, etc. Crafting all items requires 121 Stardust Fragments and 68 Luminite Bars (272 Luminite), which necessitates defeating the Stardust Pillar at least 3–11 / 2–8 times (note that the Stardust Fragment can also be crafted from the other fragments) and fighting the Moon Lord at least 4 / 3–4 times.

=== Mushroom ===
Description: The Mushroom is a crafting material and healing item that spawns randomly on grass or Hallowed grass located on the surface, generally in the Forest. It can be cut with any tool or weapon in order to retrieve the item. On the PC version, Console version, Mobile version, and tModLoader version, the Mushroom inflicts only 30 seconds of Potion Sickness, which is half the duration inflicted by healing potions. Even so, it can only heal 30 health every minute (15 health every 30 seconds,) compared to Lesser Healing Potion, which heals 50 health every minute. Mushrooms have a high sell value for the early game (40 Mushrooms sell for 1), plus they are very common and can be farmed. Mushrooms grow on any free grass tiles in the surface layer, meaning they can be easily farmed by placing grass in strips. The grass can be grown by connecting dirt to existing grass, by planting Grass Seeds, or by using the Staff of Regrowth. Only one tile of vertical clearance is required, so dirt strips can be placed close together in groups of three (more than that and you may not be able to harvest them), one tile apart vertically. Mushrooms will not grow if there is a wall behind them, so make sure the sky is visible behind the dirt strips. They do not require water to grow, and can spawn while on-screen. Such a farm also needs regular clearing — Mushrooms will not replace grass, but require empty tiles to grow. With the Dart Trap mechanism, farms can be automated to some degree. The Dart Trap(s) can be linked to a Pressure Plate at the farm's entrance or to a Timer. A launched dart will cut all grass and Mushrooms that it comes into contact with, allowing the player to simply run across the farm and pick up the dropped Mushrooms without a single swing of their sword.

=== Magic Mirrors ===
Description: The Magic Mirror is a unique item that returns a player to their spawn point. When used, a short animation plays before instantly teleporting the user to their set spawn point; if the player has previously used a bed and the bed is in a valid housing, they will appear in front of it, but if no valid bed is found the user will instead return to the world's spawn point. This teleportation occurs at no cost, and can be repeated indefinitely without consuming the mirror. An Ice Mirror is a variation on the Magic Mirror. Aside from appearance, it is identical to an ordinary Magic Mirror in every way, including acting as a valid component for a Cell Phone. Magic Mirrors can be found in gold chests generated in the Underground and Cavern layers. Ice Mirrors can be found in Frozen Chests generated in the Ice biome. Magic Mirror is also one of the equipment new Journey Mode characters get upon creation.

=== Pylons ===
Description: Pylons are furniture items that appear as a large stone or crystal hovering and rotating above a biome-themed stand. They allow a player to teleport to any other pylon by pressing the ⚷ Interact button on them, which will open the fullscreen map, and selecting the other pylon there. When two or more pylons are placed, they form the Pylon Network. The following restrictions apply to all pylons (excluding the Universal Pylon):[1] Most pylons, with the exception of the Universal Pylon, can be purchased from NPCs when the following conditions apply: The table below indicates which NPCs could be housed in the biome appropriate to the pylon (at a distance from other NPCs) to ensure that one of them is happy enough to sell the pylon. These are only examples and are not a complete list of every combination that can be used to obtain a pylon.


=== Soul of Sight ===
Description: The Soul of Sight is one of the six / seven souls that can be obtained in Hardmode. It is a crafting material dropped by The Twins. Crafting all Soul of Sight-related items requires 89 / 68 / 117 souls, meaning the player must defeat The Twins 2–4 (2–3) / 3–6 times.

=== Hardmode Anvils ===
Description: The Mythril Anvil and Orichalcum Anvil are Hardmode crafting stations that serve and extend the function of a Pre-Hardmode Anvil. These are very crucial to game advancement, as they account for making nearly every Hardmode recipe before the Ancient Manipulator. In addition to acting as a direct replacement to Lead and Iron Anvils and inheriting all of their crafting recipes, they further serve the similar function of crafting bars forged of Hardmode ores into weapons, armor and tools, as well as several other items. Mythril and Orichalcum Anvils also function as Iron and Lead Anvils, both of which similarly share identical recipe lists.

=== Gem Bunnies ===
Description: Gem Bunnies are harmless critters that can be caught with any Bug Net and do not normally interact with the player in any other way, except in that they can be killed by both players and enemies. They have 5 health and usually serve as ambient entities in Terraria. Gem Bunnies spawn near towns in the cavern layer and around Gem Trees that can be planted with Gemcorns. Their surface counterparts are Bunnies. Most naturally-spawned Gem Bunnies can be caught with a Bug Net, and carried in the player's inventory (or placed in storage). If a bunny caught with any Bug Net is taken from inventory and "used" (placed), it is again released into the environment at the cursor and behaves as usual. The Bestiary entry for Gem Bunnies: "These colorful rabbits made their way so deep, their reaction to magicked gems resulted in a coveted sparkling appearance."

=== Chests ===
Description: Chests are storage items that each hold up to 40 item stacks in rows of 10×4 / 5×8 / 5×4 (only 20 item stacks) . Chests can be freed with any pickaxe or drill, but only when empty. It is impossible to destroy the blocks underneath a placed chest that contains items. In addition to being craftable, a number of chests are created during world generation, and placed in random map locations. The loot contained in these chests is determined during world generation, and will not change if the world enters Hardmode. There are 20 varieties of naturally-occurring chests (15 of which cannot be crafted) and 27 craftable ones, plus the Barrel and Trash Can, for a total of 42 chest types and 44 placed storage items overall (besides dressers and portable storage items). There is a maximum limit of 8000 / 1000 placed storage items in each world (excluding portable storage like the Safe, Piggy Bank, Void Vault, and Defender's Forge, as well as showcase items like the Item Frame, Weapon Rack, and Mannequin). Attempts to place additional storage items beyond the max will result in a dropped item, rather than placement. On the PC, Console, Old-gen console, Mobile, Windows Phone, Old Chinese, tModLoader, and tModLoader Legacy versions, placed chests can be renamed (20 character max). Hovering the mouse cursor over a renamed chest will show its name. If the chest has not been renamed, no name will display. To rename a chest, first open it via ⚷ Interact. The default chest name reflects the chest type (e.g. a Living Wood Chest has the default name "Living Wood Chest"). Select "Rename" and enter a new name. Press ↵ Enter or press "Save" when finished. Chest names can also use the same text formatting as Announcement Boxes and chat messages. Most chests can be crafted into Trapped Chests, losing their storage capability in exchange of making them a mechanism. Ordinary Chests that occur naturally on the Surface contain various loot that the player can take and place in their own inventory. Each chest contains a single "rare item" and an assortment of randomly chosen common items. Note: A Chest can only contain one type of bar, and only the types of which the ore is generated naturally in the world. This content is transcluded from Gold Chest § Loot.The loot for any given chest is determined by the location in which it is found. Each chest contains a single primary item and an assortment of randomly chosen common items. The primary item is first placed in the chest, then each "set" of common items is checked to see whether or not it will be added. If a set is chosen to be added, a single item from the list is added to the chest. Sets are displayed in the list below divided by horizontal borders. For example, the Wooden Arrow and the Shuriken both reside in the same set, so they will never both appear in the same chest.

=== Yellow Willow Sapling ===
Description: The Yellow Willow Sapling is a seed purchased from the Zoologist once the Bestiary is 30% complete (162 entries). When planted, it grows into a Yellow Willow tree, which is a tree that can also spawn naturally in the forest. Its appearance is decorative and it functions identically to regular forest trees.


=== Cages ===
Description: Cages are placeable decorative furniture items that display animated critters. A critter caught with any bug net is combined with a Terrarium to craft a cage. Gold cages are regular cages containing gold critters. They sell for 10 each. Aside from the sell price, they are the same as regular cages. Cages are background furniture. All cages measure either 6 tiles wide by 3 high, or 3 tiles wide by 2 high, and are partially transparent. Cages can be converted back into their ingredients by throwing the cage into shimmer. There are currently 57 cages in-game, 10 of which are golden variants. The behavior of a caged critter is described by its action pattern. This pattern, while seemingly random, is based on certain rules and chances.[1] These are visualized below.

=== Victorian Goth set ===
Description: The Victorian Goth set is a vanity set consisting of the Victorian Goth Hat and Victorian Goth Dress. These items are to be equipped in the Social Slots as they only provide a visual appearance. They are purchased from the Clothier for 20 (set) when he is spoken to in the Graveyard biome.


=== Ice Blocks ===
Description: Ice Blocks are a common block type found alongside Snow Blocks in the Snow and Ice biomes. They can be mined with a pickaxe or drill. Ice Blocks have low friction, causing a player walking over them to slide when stopping or changing directions. This effect can be mitigated by equipping Ice Skates or other accessories crafted from them. Ice Blocks can be converted into three other variants via the spread of biomes: These will also spread their respective biomes. Note that only normal Ice Blocks can be used in most crafting. Pink, Purple and Red Ice Blocks cannot be used in conjunction with, nor as a substitute to, Ice Blocks, and as such must be converted beforehand if usage is desired. Pink, Purple and Red Ice Blocks can only be used in the crafting of Ice Torches and their respective Hallowed, Corrupt and Crimson Torches. There is no way in the game to melt ice into water, nor to freeze water into ice.

Each booster will increase speed by 20mph, regardless of minecart variant.


=== Candelabras ===
Description: The Candelabra is a light source that emits light when placed on a flat surface such as blocks, Platforms, and flat furniture items. It is not destroyed by water. There are currently 36 / 28 craftable and 5 looted variations of the Candelabra.

=== Gold Ring ===
Description: The Gold Ring is a Hardmode accessory that rarely drops from enemies exclusive to the Pirate Invasion, with the exception of Parrots. It has a 0.4*1/250 (0.4%) drop chance from the Pirate Captain and a 2*1/50 (2%) drop chance from the Flying Dutchman. Every other enemy has a 0.1*1/1000 (0.1%) chance to drop it. Equipping the Gold Ring increases the player's coin pickup radius to 25 tiles, instead of the normal 3-tile radius. This item works similarly to the Celestial Magnet, Treasure Magnet and Heartreach.

=== Clentaminator ===
Description: The Clentaminator is a Hardmode tool sold by the Steampunker which can be used to convert blocks and plants to different biome equivalents. The converted biome type is determined by the ammunition solution used (sold separately). The Clentaminator (and its upgrade) is the fastest means of spreading/removing Hallow, Corruption and Crimson. It converts Grass, Trees, Ice, Sand, and Stone, but NOT between mud and dirt. This means that it will convert between Desert and Snow biome (changing snow/sand in the process) or between Jungle and Glowing Mushroom biome (changing jungle/mushroom grass). It will NOT convert very well between Jungle and The Hallow because it can't switch between mud and dirt. If creating a new mud/dirt biome from scratch, an Axe of Regrowth (or Staff of Regrowth) will quickly spread grass deeply into new blocks. Planting grass on the surface layer does not convert the deeper mud/dirt blocks to the appropriate biome type. It has a similar firing pattern to the Flamethrower, but has a much longer range, fires through blocks and works in water. The Clentaminator as well as most Solutions can be purchased from the Steampunker for 2 and 15, respectively. The Clentaminator can be upgraded into the Terraformer by submerging the Clentaminator in Shimmer after Moon Lord has been defeated. The Clentaminator cannot be reforged, and therefore cannot have modifiers. This content is transcluded from Solutions § Types.

=== Block-placing wands ===
Description: Block-placing wands are special tools that allow the player to place blocks they would normally not be able to place. They do not consume any mana. Each wand consumes a specific material from the player's inventory (details listed below). There are currently 6 / 4 different block-placing wands. The Bone Wand places Bone Blocks at the cost of one Bone per block, which can be mined back as bones. On the PC version, Console version, Mobile version, and tModLoader version, the block can be mined back as Bone, whereas on the Old-gen console version, Windows Phone version, Old Chinese version, Nintendo 3DS version, and tModLoader 1.3-Legacy version, the placed blocks remain as Bone Blocks even if later mined and do not return to normal Bone. The Bone Wand has a 0.4*1/250 (0.4%) chance to drop from Angry Bones, Dark Casters, and Cursed Skulls, which spawn in the Dungeon. The Hive Wand places Hives as blocks, which otherwise cannot be placed. Hives must be in the player's inventory in order to place them. It has a 33.33*1/3 (33.33%) chance to be dropped by Queen Bee. Mining a Hive block placed with the Hive Wand is the same as mining a naturally generated one, hence it can spawn Bees or honey. The Hive Wand resembles a Honey Dipper, a utensil used for viscous liquids such as honey in real life. The Living Wood Wand places Living Wood blocks at the cost of one Wood each. The blocks placed are the same as found in Living Trees. It can be found in Living Wood Chests that are found within Living Trees, and (on ) obtained from shaking Forest trees. The Living Wood Wand is only able to use regular Wood. It cannot use Boreal Wood, Palm Wood, Ash Wood, Rich Mahogany, Shadewood, Ebonwood, Pearlwood, Dynasty Wood, or Spooky Wood. The Leaf Wand places Leaf Blocks at the cost of one Wood each. The blocks placed are the same as found in Living Trees and have the same properties. It can be found in Living Wood Chests that are found within Living Trees, and (on ) obtained from shaking Forest trees. Like the Living Wood Wand, the Leaf Wand is only able to use regular Wood. It cannot use Boreal Wood, Palm Wood, Ash Wood Rich Mahogany, Shadewood, Ebonwood, Pearlwood, Dynasty Wood, or Spooky Wood. The Living Mahogany Wand places Living Mahogany blocks at the cost of one Rich Mahogany each. The blocks placed are the same as those found in Living Mahogany Trees. It can be found in Ivy Chests found within Living Mahogany Trees and Jungle Shrines in the Underground Jungle biome, and (on ) obtained from shaking Jungle trees. The Living Mahogany Wand is only able to use Rich Mahogany. It cannot use regular Wood, Boreal Wood, Palm Wood, Shadewood, Ebonwood, Pearlwood, Dynasty Wood, or Spooky Wood. The Rich Mahogany Leaf Wand places Mahogany Leaf Blocks at the cost of one Rich Mahogany each. The blocks placed are the same as found in Living Mahogany Trees and have the same properties. It can be found in Ivy Chests found within Living Mahogany Trees and Jungle Shrines in the Underground Jungle biome, and (on ) obtained from shaking Jungle trees. Like the Living Mahogany Wand, the Rich Mahogany Leaf Wand is only able to use Rich Mahogany. It cannot use regular Wood, Boreal Wood, Palm Wood, Shadewood, Ebonwood, Pearlwood, Dynasty Wood, or Spooky Wood.

=== Gem Locks ===
Description: A Gem Lock is a special mechanism which acts as a container or altar for a Large Gem. A Gem Lock will emit an activation signal if the corresponding Large Gem is placed inside it and once again if it gets removed. This allows for a simple contraption that uses only one mechanism to keep something like a door open as long as the gem is inside the lock, because if it gets taken out it will immediately close. Gem Locks are primarily used in the making of adventure maps, where the player must complete some objective to be rewarded with the gem required to continue.

=== Lesser Restoration Potion ===
Description: The Lesser Restoration Potion is a potion that has the effects of both the Lesser Healing Potion and Lesser Mana Potion. On the Old Chinese version and tModLoader 1.3-Legacy version, they are no longer craftable and have instead been replaced by the Restoration Potion. However, they can still be found inside Shadow Chests in The Underworld. On the PC version, Console version, Mobile version, and tModLoader version, they are removed partially, and are replaced with Restoration Potions when cheated through inventory editors.

=== Ash Wood Bow ===
Description: The Ash Wood Bow is a type of bow crafted from Ash Wood. It is similar to the Wooden Bow, but it deals 6 more damage and has a higher velocity. Its best modifier is Demonic, as it does not have any knockback and thus cannot get modifiers that affect it. It can also get the Deadly modifier, which, while the Demonic modifier may provide the greatest damage per hit, grants a higher increase to the overall DPS.

=== Banners (decorative) ===
Description: Banners are decorative furniture items that can be placed on the underside of blocks. Many are found naturally-placed in various biomes. There are also four crafted Banners (red, green, blue, and yellow). Banners can be hung off of blocks and off of platforms which are in their bottom position (after being struck three times with a hammer). Faction Flags are Banners found in Dungeons. In post-Plantera worlds, the Faction Flags found hanging in a particular Dungeon area correspond to the background wall type (brick, slab, or tile), both of which signify the types of enemies that will spawn there. See Dungeon for more info. There are currently a total of 23 decorative Banners: 4 crafted, 6 Faction Flags, 3 Floating Island, 6 Underworld, 3 Pyramid, 1 dropped from the Dark Mage during the Old One's Army event. These are Banners found placed in the Dungeon, in the same regions that are marked by different background walls. In their original locations, the banners hint at what Hardmode Dungeon enemies will spawn nearby once Plantera has been defeated. There are only 3 types of Underworld banner per world.


=== Flask of Fire ===
Description: The Flask of Fire is a flask that will cause any melee weapons (and whips) to inflict the On Fire![1] debuff. On the PC version, Console version, Mobile version, Old Chinese version, tModLoader version, and tModLoader 1.3-Legacy version, this effect will not be lost when the player dies. The Flask of Fire cannot be used in conjunction with other flasks, and using it will remove any existing flask effects. This item currently does not apply the debuff in PvP scenarios. The debuff lasts for 3–6 seconds.

=== Work Benches ===
Description: Work Benches are a type of crafting station required to craft many essential early-game items. They are also one possible way to fulfill a house's flat surface item requirement. Bottles, Pink Vases, and Mugs can be placed on it and used as a Placed Bottle for crafting potions. The Work Bench is the first crafting station the player can make in the game, and one of the first items overall. There are 34 / 26 types of Work Benches which can be crafted, and 7 types which must be picked up from areas such as the Dungeon. Some Work Benches can also be found in Underground Cabins, in which they follow the theme of the cabin they are found in.

=== Black Scorpion ===
Description: Black Scorpions are harmless critters that can be caught with a Bug Net and do not normally interact with the player in any other way, except in that they can be killed by both players and enemies. They have 5 health and usually serve as ambient entities in Terraria. Black Scorpions only spawn in the Desert. Its counterpart is the Scorpion. Most naturally spawned Black Scorpions can be caught with a Bug Net, and carried in the player's inventory (or placed in storage). If a critter caught with any Bug Net is taken from inventory and "used" (placed), it is again released into the environment at the cursor and behaves as usual. On PC, Console, Mobile, Old Chinese, tModLoader, and tModLoader Legacy, Black Scorpions can be sold to any NPC vendor. All caught Black Scorpions can be crafted into Black Scorpion Cages to create animated display furniture. Once crafted, the critter cannot be released. A Black Scorpion Cage occupies a 6x3 space. It displays an animated Black Scorpion inside. On PC, Console, Mobile, tModLoader, and tModLoader Legacy, Critters spawned from statues cannot be caught with the Bug Net; attempting to do so will cause the critter to disappear in a puff of smoke. A Black Scorpion can be used for fishing, with a bait power of 15%.

=== Sunflower ===
Description: Sunflowers are large plants which can be found growing naturally on grass, and can be freed with a pickaxe or drill, or by coming into contact with water. They cannot be grown from seeds like most other plants, but are instead placed fully-grown, either naturally upon world generation or by the player. They can also be purchased from the Dryad for 50 each, while a Blood Moon is not occurring. Sunflowers provide the following functions: Sunflowers can only be placed on regular, Hallowed, or Jungle grass, at any height. They cannot be placed on Corrupt grass, Crimson grass, bare Dirt Blocks, nor in Clay Pots or Planter Boxes.


=== Angler/Quests ===


=== Will's set ===
Description: Will's set are vanity developer items that can be obtained rarely (5% chance) from Treasure Bags in Expert Mode. It is the vanity set made for Phlebas, an artist who formerly developed graphics for Terraria. Equipping the full set produces a glow effect similar to Spooky armor and grants an after-image movement effect similar to Ninja armor. Will's equipment also includes a non-vanity item, which will drop in addition to his clothing set:


=== Shrub Star ===
Description: The Shrub Star is a pet item that drops from the Everscream in Master Mode with a 25*1/4 (25%) chance. It summons an Everscream Sapling that will follow the player around.


=== Greater Healing Potion ===
Description: The Greater Healing Potion is a Hardmode / pre-Hardmode potion that restores 150 health. Consumption will trigger the Potion Sickness debuff. Greater Healing Potions can be crafted or obtained from Hardmode bosses and Biome Mimics. On the Old-gen console version, Windows Phone version, Old Chinese version, Nintendo 3DS version, and tModLoader 1.3-Legacy version, they can be obtained from Golden Crates, but on the PC version, Console version, Mobile version, and tModLoader version, they cannot be obtained outside of Hardmode.

=== Demon Scythe ===
Description: The Demon Scythe is a magic weapon that fires circular projectiles that can pierce through multiple enemies and/or large enemies for multiple hits on each. Each projectile pierces four times, then dissipates. Its projectiles have little to no movement when they initially spawn, then they gradually gain speed. The Demon Scythe has a 2.86*1/35 (2.86%) chance of being dropped by Demons and Voodoo Demons in The Underworld. Its best modifier is Mythical.


=== Torches ===
Description: Torches are furniture items that produce light when placed, held, or dropped (via the Throw key), and are crucial at all stages of gameplay as primary light sources. Torches provide light permanently, and are never consumed. Regular torches can be found randomly in chests and Pots, as a bonus drop from slimes, or purchased from the Merchant or Skeleton Merchant for 50 each. Torches can be placed on the sides or tops of most blocks, on background walls, and on the sides of trees and Wooden Beams. In the PC version they can be placed on any type of platform. A placed torch can be retrieved by pressing the ⚷ Interact key on it or by freeing it with a pickaxe or drill. When the block a torch is attached to is broken, the torch will attach itself to any other block or wall directly adjacent to it. If all adjacent blocks surrounding a torch are removed (left, right, and bottom), and no wall exists behind it, it drops like any other item. Torches are also mechanisms that can be toggled on and off via Wire. Placing at least 100 torches in close proximity, at a depth of at least 200 below surface level in any biome, will start the Torch God mini-event. This will grant the Torch God's Favor, which will allow the player to automatically convert ordinary torches to one of the biome types. This can produce Desert, Jungle, Ice, Hallowed, Crimson, or Corrupt Torches in the respective biomes; it can also produce Bone Torches in the Dungeon, and Demon Torches in the Underworld. Standard Torches produce an orange flame, and cannot be placed in liquids. They are crafted with Wood and Gel, but can also be purchased from the Merchant (always) or the Skeleton Merchant (during the second half of every in-game minute) for 50 each. Besides being used to craft various other light sources, they are also used to craft Flaming Arrow, Molotov Cocktails, and the Flaming Mace. Purple, Yellow, Blue, Green, Red, White and Orange Torches can be made by combining standard Torches with gems. There are nine available colors, one for each of the seven gem colors, plus the Pink Torch crafted with Pink Gel and the Rainbow Torch crafted with Rainbow Brick. With the exception of their colors and light levels, these function identically to a standard Torch. The Rainbow Torch cycles through various colors. The Pink Torch is used to craft the Peace Candle, and the Rainbow Torch is used to craft the Rainbow Campfire. Ice Torches are crafted by combining standard torches with Ice Blocks or, in PC, Console, Mobile, and tModLoader, with Pink Ice Blocks, Purple Ice Blocks, or Red Ice Blocks. They give off a pale blue light. The Ice Torch has a slightly different graphic to the rest of the colored torches. Besides being used to craft the Frozen Campfire and various Frozen and Boreal light sources, they are also used to craft Frostburn Arrows. Bone Torches are sold by the Skeleton Merchant for 1 each during the first half of every in-game minute (a real-world second), other times he sells ordinary Torches. They are used to craft Bone Campfires. Bone Torches regularly produce long-lasting sparks which can map out a fair distance below them. Another way of acquiring Bone Torches is placing and immediately breaking Torches in the Dungeon with the Torch God's Favor. These can be used anywhere outside the Snow biome, Desert, Jungle, Corruption, Crimson, Hallow, Dungeon or Jungle Temple biomes for extra luck, and especially in the Underworld for increased fishing chances. Ultrabright Torches cannot be crafted, but are sometimes sold by the Traveling Merchant for 3 each. They shine brighter than normal torches when held. They are used to craft Ultrabright Campfires and Living Ultrabright Fire Blocks. Demon Torches can be taken from the Ruined Houses in the Underworld, where they occur naturally. On PC, Console, Mobile, Old Chinese, tModLoader, and tModLoader Legacy, they can also be crafted by combining standard torches with Obsidian. They function identically to standard, colored and Ice Torches, except that they cycle smoothly between emitting red, purple, and blue light. They are used to craft Demon Campfires and Living Demon Fire Blocks. These torches become available in Hardmode, and emit a bright green or yellow light, respectively. They are nearly unique in that they can be held or placed in liquids and still function normally there. They are crafted by combining standard Torches with Cursed Flames (Cursed Torches) or Ichor (Ichor Torches). They are used to craft Cursed Campfires and Ichor Campfires, respectively. Desert Torches are crafted by combining standard torches with Hardened Sand Blocks, Hardened Crimsand Blocks, Hardened Ebonsand Blocks or Hardened Pearlsand Blocks. They are used to craft Desert Campfires. Coral Torches are crafted by combining standard torches with Coral. The Coral Torch has a slightly different graphic to the rest of the colored torches. They can be placed in Water and still function normally there. They are used to craft Coral Campfires. Corrupt Torches are crafted by combining standard torches with Ebonstone Blocks, Hardened Ebonsand Blocks or Purple Ice Blocks. They are used to craft Corrupt Campfires. Crimson Torches are crafted by combining standard torches with Crimstone Blocks, Hardened Crimsand Blocks or Red Ice Blocks. They are used to craft Crimson Campfires. These torches become available in Hardmode. Hallowed Torches are crafted by combining standard torches with Pearlstone Blocks, Hardened Pearlsand Blocks or Pink Ice Blocks. They are used to craft Hallowed Campfires. Jungle Torches are crafted by combining standard torches with Jungle Spores. They are used to craft Jungle Campfires. Aether Torches are created by throwing torches into Shimmer. Mushroom Torches are crafted by combining standard torches with Glowing Mushrooms. They are used to craft Mushroom Campfires. By placing or holding Torches in the correct locations, players can gain an increase of up to 0.2 to their luck.

=== Mana Regeneration Band ===
Description: The Mana Regeneration Band is an accessory item made by combining a Band of Starpower and a Band of Regeneration at a Tinkerer's Workshop. It somewhat combines the effects of both bands, expanding a player's mana pool and converting the bonus health regeneration provided by the Band of Regeneration into mana regeneration. The Band of Starpower, which is required for crafting the Mana Regeneration Band, is generally exclusive to worlds with Corruption, as it is obtained from Shadow Orbs and Corrupt Crates. Therefore, obtaining a Mana Regeneration Band in worlds with Crimson requires creating an artificial Corruption biome, e.g. by purchasing Corrupt Seeds from the Dryad in a Hardmode Graveyard. On the PC version, Console version, Mobile version, and tModLoader version, the Band of Starpower can also be crafted from a Panic Necklace, however. On the Windows Phone version and Nintendo 3DS version, the Band of Starpower can additionally often be found in Living Wood Chests in Living Trees in any world.

=== Rockets ===
Description: Rockets are a Hardmode, post-Plantera type of ammunition which are mainly sold by the Cyborg. The Rocket I variant is also dropped by Plantera when it drops the Grenade Launcher. Most launchers use Rockets as ammunition. All rocket types have two significant defining traits: area of effect, and the ability to destroy tiles. Rockets I and II have a small area of effect, closest to that of a Bomb or Grenade, while Rockets III and IV have an area similar to the blast radius of Dynamite. Rockets I and III will leave tiles unaffected, while II and IV will break blocks and furniture in their blast radius (except for explosion-proof objects). In most cases, a rocket's splash damage will harm the player who fired it if they are caught in the blast radius. These explosions will not affect other players unless they have PvP enabled, however. There are currently 12 / 4 different rockets available in Terraria, all of which are Hardmode-exclusive. Some rockets have unusual behavior in certain launchers, including transforming rockets into different kinds of projectiles with unusual behaviors. This table lists how some of the basic properties of the rocket variants are affected by the different rocket-using launchers. Additional info on how and why some of these changes happen can be found on the launchers' individual pages. Template:Eil/options Template:Eil/options


=== Apprentice armor ===
Description: The Apprentice armor is a Hardmode magic and summoning armor set purchased from the Tavernkeep for 450000*45 in total, which consists of the Apprentice's Hat, Apprentice's Robe and Apprentice's Trousers. The total bonus to max number of sentries is +2, allowing 3 to be summoned at once. The Dark Artist armor can be considered a direct upgrade of the Apprentice armor. A full set of Apprentice armor will provide the following benefits: The set bonus of the Apprentice armor gives a 40% increase to Flameburst sentries' projectile velocity, a 50% increase to target range, and a 90% increase to field of view.


=== Cannonball ===
Description: Cannonballs are ammunition used by the Cannon. While held by the player or selected in the hotbar, using ⚒ Use / Attack on a cannon will fire one shot from the cannon's current angle. Cannonballs can also be fired from in the inventory by clicking on the cannon while holding the Auto Select key. On contact with a solid block, a Cannonball will explode, dealing damage in a small radius but leaving placed blocks intact. Cannonballs are puchased from the Pirate for 15 each.


=== Shiverthorn Seeds ===
Description: Shiverthorn Seeds are a type of seed that can be obtained from harvesting Shiverthorns while they are blooming or using the Staff of Regrowth on a naturally grown Shiverthorns while they are fully grown. Shiverthorn will always bloom after a period of growth, and unlike other herbs, remains in-bloom permanently thereafter. Blooming Shiverthorn emits a glowing particle effect. Each plant drops 1–3 Shiverthorn Seeds when harvested while blooming. Shiverthorn Seeds can be placed on Snow Blocks and any type of Ice Blocks, empty Clay Pots, or any types of Planter Boxes, even inside water or honey, and will grow into harvestable Shiverthorns. They will grow anywhere, not just in the Snow biome, but will only yield seeds when blooming.


=== Golf Clubs ===
Description: Golf Clubs are tools used in the golf minigame. There are four types of Golf Clubs, the Driver, Iron, Wedge, and Putter, which are each used to hit the Golf Ball a different horizontal and vertical distance. Special variants of Golf Clubs can be unlocked by achieving different golf scores. All upgrades are purely aesthetic, despite being more expensive as the tier increases. They do not harm enemies or critters. These clubs are used in short- to medium-range shots, as they generate a decent amount of loft and power. These clubs are used for long-distance shots, as they generate large amounts of power and low loft. These clubs are best to hurdle or escape hazards, as they generate a massive vertical loft and are also used to get on the green. These clubs are best at close-range shots, as they generate almost no vertical loft.


=== Bee Cloak ===
Description: The Bee Cloak is a Hardmode accessory that combines the effects of the Star Cloak and the Honey Comb. When the player is injured, three stars will fall on the player's current location and bees are released.

=== Beams ===
Description: Beams or columns are background furniture items that provide support for torches and can be used as decoration. They form continuous vertical pillars when stacked. They are found naturally in Underground Cabins, and can be crafted. Beams and columns can be stacked from the ground, and exist in the background, providing support for suspended torches that will not inhibit character movement. In this way, beams and columns provide a function similar to trees (which also exist in the background and allow the player to suspend high torches), but which the player can construct where they like. Where background walls exist, beams and columns can also be placed in "midair", without support from below. Despite their appearance as background walls, beams and columns instead share a layer with other furniture items (like tables, torches, statues, Switches, timers, etc.), thus the two cannot share the same tile space. They can also prevent a door from opening.

=== Thrown Water ===
Description: Thrown Water refers to a set of three consumable weapons that each convert a small area into a biome (Hallow, Corruption, or Crimson for Holy Water, Unholy Water, and Blood Water respectively) when thrown. This conversion affects a roughly circular area with a radius of four tiles from the center. Enemies within this radius are also damaged slightly; this damage is not classified as any of the four damage types and therefore cannot be modified by any buffs or equipment. Holy Water is only available in Hardmode. It is possible for Corrupted or Crimson Deserts to be generated naturally with the world, making the other two throwable waters available from the beginning of the game, however these biomes will not spread onto sand until Hardmode begins, therefore worlds generated without Corrupted/Crimson Deserts will not have Ebonsand/Crimsand until then. On the PC version, Console version, Mobile version, and tModLoader version, however, Vile Powder or Vicious Powder can be used to convert sand into its corrupt counterpart.

Wearing the full set will cause Lightning Aura sentry summons to deal damage 20% faster and allow them to deal critical hits at a fixed 16.7% rate. The Shinobi Infiltrator armor can be considered a direct upgrade of the Monk armor. A full set of Monk armor provides the following benefits:


=== Muramasa ===
Description: The Muramasa is a blue broadsword that is found in the Dungeon's Locked Gold Chests or in Golden Lock Boxes, both of which are opened via a Golden Key. The Muramasa has a slightly longer reach than the Phaseblade and has a very fast attack speed. It is also worth mentioning that it is an autoswing sword, not many of which can be found during Pre-Hardmode. It also emits a small amount of light when swung. Its best modifier is Legendary.

=== Sky Mill ===
Description: The Sky Mill is a crafting station found in Skyware Chests on Floating Islands. It is used to craft sky-themed blocks and the Skyware furniture set. On the PC version, Console version, Mobile version, and tModLoader version, the Sky Mill can also be purchased from the Steampunker for 10 if the player is in Space.


=== Moss ===
Description: Moss is a grass-like plant that grows on Stone Blocks. It comes in 11 / 6 / 5 different colors, and one color can be found throughout each third of a given map (three colors per world), either randomly on cave surfaces or in moss chambers with a matching mossy wall. Mossy stone requires one more hit to break than clean stone. Moss will be destroyed if the Stone Block it is on converts to Ebonstone, Crimstone, or Pearlstone. Moss sprouts fuzz that can be cut like grass weeds. On the PC version, Console version, Mobile version, and tModLoader version, moss can be collected using a Paint Scraper or Spectre Paint Scraper. Only 11.11*1/9 (11.11%) of such moss will drop as an item when using either scraper, the rest will simply disappear as usual.[1] Collected moss can be placed on Stone Blocks and Gray Bricks, or used to craft mossy walls. Lava Moss is a special variant of moss that can only be found in the lava layers of the Cavern, though if harvested, it can be planted at any level. Despite not being considered one of the glowing mosses, it glows in the dark. Glowing mosses are special variants of moss that grow in glowing moss biomes in much larger areas than standard moss, and glow in the dark similarly to Lava Moss. There are five variants of glowing moss: Krypton (green), Xenon (blue), Argon (pink), Neon (violet), and Helium (color-changing) Mosses. Only one type of glowing moss can be found in each world, in a total of up to two (small world) / three (medium) / four (large) glowing moss biomes in the Cavern layer, mostly above the lava layers, but not under the spawn area.

=== Pygmy Staff ===
Description: The Pygmy Staff is a Hardmode, post-Plantera summon weapon. It spawns a pygmy minion that follows the player and attacks enemies with a ranged spear attack. Like other minions, the summoned Pygmies is invincible and follows the player for an unlimited amount of time, unless the player dies, summons a replacement minion, cancels the buff, or leaves the world. The Pygmy Staff is dropped by Plantera with a 25*1/4 (25%) / 50*1/2 (50%) chance. Its best modifier is Ruthless. The Mythical modifier provides the widest array of stat bonuses, but these primarily affect the initial summon rather than the resulting minion. Additionally, minions cannot deal critical hits. The only lasting advantage a Mythical Pygmy Staff has over a Ruthless one is knockback.


=== Corrupt Walls ===
Description: Corrupt Walls are naturally-generating background walls found in the Corruption. These naturally occurring walls can be destroyed with a hammer, but will drop nothing. These walls also do not stop enemies from spawning and cannot be used for proper housing. On the PC version, Console version, Mobile version, and tModLoader version, these walls can be crafted from Ebonstone where they can be used like other craftable walls.

=== Bundle of Horseshoe Balloons ===
Description: The Bundle of Horseshoe Balloons is an accessory that allows the wearer to perform a quadruple jump, negates fall damage, and increases the player's jump height by 33% and jump speed by 30%. Each of the jumps has an effect from the different combined items: sandstorm jump, then blizzard jump, then cloud jump. Crafting this item requires three of the variants of Cloud in a Balloon, which in turn requires a total of 3 Shiny Red Balloons. In particular it requires the relatively rare Sandstorm in a Bottle, which can only be found in a Pyramid or from an Oasis Crate, and a Lucky Horseshoe. If crafted from 2 or more horseshoe balloons, only one horseshoe is preserved in the final bundle; additional horseshoes used in the crafting will be lost (cannot be shimmered apart). To avoid this, shimmer apart all but one of horseshoe balloons before crafting the bundle.

=== Demonite Bar ===
Description: Demonite Bars are a pre-Hardmode type of bars. Crafting most items involving Demonite requires that Demonite Ore be crafted into bars first. Demonite Bars are crafted from Demonite Ore at a Furnace. They are The Corruption equivalent of The Crimson's Crimtane Bars, representing the second-highest metal tier before Hardmode.

It increases enemy spawn rate by 33% and maximum number of simultaneous on-screen enemies by 50% when placed or held, and can be turned off ( ). Multiple placed candles do not stack, but the bonuses from holding and placing a candle do. The Peace Candle reduces enemy spawn rate in contrast to the Water Candle. There are currently 37 craftable Candles, and 5 non-craftable Candles: 3 from the Dungeon, 1 from the Ruined House, and 1 from the Pirate Invasion. With a total of 42 Candles.

=== Shrimpy Truffle ===
Description: The Shrimpy Truffle is a mount-summon item that spawns Cute Fishron, a miniature rideable Duke Fishron-style mount. The mount can fly and hover indefinitely. It is obtained from Duke Fishron's Treasure Bag in Expert Mode. Cute Fishron has a base flight speed of 40 / 33 mph. Moving through liquids causes Cute Fishron to gain a drastic movement speed bonus of about +105% (to 82 mph, the fastest of any mount), as well as providing the rider with a +15% damage bonus. These boosts continue for 6 seconds after it leaves liquid, though during this time its speed boost drops to +100% (to 80 / 66 mph). Liquid boosts also take effect when Cute Fishron gets "wet" by flying in the rain (), flying through Bubbles filled by liquids, splashes from a Water Bucket, or being hit by a Water Gun. On the PC version, Console version, Mobile version, and tModLoader version, the +100% movement speed boost (80 / 66 mph) and +15% damage boost also take effect when the rider's health falls below half. During contact with any blocks, Cute Fishron's movement speed is drastically lowered to a very slow crawl (5 mph, or 10 if boosted). This speed penalty is removed as soon as it loses contact with the blocks.


=== Lihzahrd Altar ===
Description: The Lihzahrd Altar is found naturally placed in the final chamber of the Jungle Temple, and is used with a Lihzahrd Power Cell to summon the Golem boss. Each summoning consumes one Power Cell from the player's inventory. Like Lihzahrd Bricks, the Altar can only be removed with a Picksaw, Laser Drill, or a Luminite Pickaxe. Once picked up, the Altar can be placed anywhere and used to summon the Golem in any area, as long as Plantera has been defeated in the current world.


=== Shadow armor ===
Description: Shadow armor is an armor set that consists of the Shadow Helmet, Shadow Scalemail, and Shadow Greaves. The individual pieces provide a total of 19 defense, equal to its Crimson counterpart, Crimson armor. Each of the 3 pieces provide a +5% boost to critical strike chance (for a total of +15%), while wearing all 3 pieces at once grants an additional set bonus of +15% movement speed and an acceleration speed bonus. Wearing a full set causes the player to display an afterimage effect during motion (similar to Necro armor) and emit shadow particles. Also, the Rocket Boots will emit purple flames (this does not occur with Spectre Boots or any of its derivatives). Crafting a full set requires a total of 60 Demonite Bars (180 / 240 Demonite Ore) and 45 Shadow Scales. Defeating the Eater of Worlds twice can provide enough to craft a full set. Shadow armor pieces are interchangeable with pieces from the Ancient Shadow armor set, while still providing the same 15% increased movement speed set bonus, but not the afterimage effect.

=== Pearlstone Block ===
Description: Pearlstone is a Hardmode block type found in The Hallow. It requires at least a Nightmare Pickaxe, Deathbringer Pickaxe, or explosives to mine. Pearlstone is the Hallow version of Stone (similar to Ebonstone in The Corruption, or Crimstone in The Crimson). In a way similar to Ebonstone and Crimstone, Pearlstone can be converted into ordinary Stone via Vile Powder, Vicious Powder, or the Clentaminator with the Green Solution. During the initial creation of the Hallow biome upon the defeat of the Wall of Flesh, Stone blocks in the conversion path become Pearlstone blocks (see Hardmode). Pearlstone itself also continues to spread Hallow to all Stone, Sand, Ice, and Grass covered dirt within a three tile radius. Over time, it will grow Crystal Shards if it is in the Underground or below.

=== Hematic Crate ===
Description: The Hematic Crate is a Hardmode crate that can only be obtained by fishing in the Crimson. Hematic Crates contain items found in standard crates, and additionally always drop an item normally obtained by breaking a Crimson Heart. Its pre-Hardmode counterpart is the Crimson Crate. Note: Only one type of ore and one type of bar can drop, not both a pre-Hardmode type of ore and a Hardmode type of ore, or both a pre-Hardmode type of bar and a Hardmode type of bar. The table above implies otherwise with the respective groups being in separate rows, but that is for readability purposes. The chance that a type of ore is dropped is 14.29*1/7 (14.29%), and the chance that a type of bar is dropped is 25*1/4 (25%).

=== Wallpapers ===
Description: Wallpapers are a group of walls purchased from the Painter. Despite the name, they work just like any other type of wall and do not have to be applied onto other walls. As such, they can be placed and used to prevent enemies from spawning, and can be used to fulfill the requirements of a house. Christmas-themed wallpaper can only be purchased during the Christmas seasonal event.


=== Birdie Rattle ===
Description: The Birdie Rattle is a pet-summoning item that can be purchased from the Traveling Merchant for 1. It is used to summon the Lil' Harpy pet. The Lil' Harpy, when summoned, will fly above and behind the player, and will behave similar to the Zephyr Fish, continually flying around and looking side to side. It will never land, and can fly through blocks.


=== Lightning Carrot ===
Description: The Lightning Carrot is a pet-summoning item purchased from the Zoologist for 50 after completing 50% of the Bestiary. It summons a Volt Bunny pet that follows the player around. When flying to keep pace with the player, the Volt Bunny emits a decent amount of light while moving erratically, which can spread light over an area. If there are no available tiles for the pet to "sit on" like when climbing walls or flying, the Volt Bunny will constantly jump around too.


=== Gold Bar ===

=== Solar Flare armor ===
Description: Solar Flare armor is a post-Moon Lord set of armor that provides melee weapon boosts. It is currently the final melee set available on the PC version, Console version, Mobile version, Old Chinese version, tModLoader version, and tModLoader 1.3-Legacy version. This armor set also provides the most base defense. Crafting it requires a total of 36 Luminite Bars (144 Luminite) and 45 Solar Fragments. A full set of the Solar Flare armor will provide the following benefits: Equipping the full set additionally provides a special set bonus that builds the longer the player avoids damage, up to 3 "charges" (similar to Beetle armor). Each takes 3 / 5 seconds to build. The charges provide a fixed damage reduction of 20%/30% regardless of the number of charges. The number of charges built is indicated by a shield that appears after the first charge, with two and three spikes appearing on the shield on the second and third charges, respectively. Taking damage causes one charge to deplete, and discharges fire explosions around the player that can damage enemies in the vicinity. A charge can also be discharged manually by using the shield's special "dash" attack, activated by double-tapping ◀ Left or ▶ Right. Dashing only consumes a charge if it strikes an enemy, and upon doing so causes a similar explosion. Regardless of depleted charges, a player can only dash once per second. The set bonus also grants 12% base damage reduction, which stacks multiplicatively with the damage reduction from the shield. Each piece equipped (even if hidden by vanity items) causes the player to emit light, with a higher light level for each additional piece equipped. Additionally, equipping the full set displays both an after-image motion effect and a pulsating effect, similar to Hallowed armor.

Description: Lamps are a piece of Furniture that produces light when placed. They also count as a valid House lighting and can be toggled on and off by mechanisms. There are 34 / 26 types of craftable Lamps, three types that are found in the Dungeon (Green, Blue, or Pink Dungeon Lamp), one found in Underworld houses (Obsidian Lamp), and one that can be dropped during a Pirate Invasion (Golden Lamp). All are functionally identical, and differ only in their appearance. The Tiki Torch shares its Tile ID with the rest of these Lamps. Also see Lamp Post, which does not count as valid House lighting.

=== Imp Staff ===
Description: The Imp Staff is a pre-Hardmode summon weapon. It spawns a miniature Flying Imp minion that follows the player around and fires fireballs at enemies. The Imp's fireballs always inflict the On Fire! debuff for 3–6 seconds, and travel in a straight line, piercing an infinite number of enemies. Like other minions, the summoned Imp is invincible and follows the player for an unlimited amount of time, unless the player dies, summons a replacement minion, cancels the buff, or leaves the world. Its best modifier is Ruthless. The Mythical modifier provides the widest array of stat bonuses, but these primarily affect the initial summon rather than the resulting minion. Additionally, minions cannot deal critical hits. The only lasting advantage a Mythical Imp Staff has over a Ruthless one is knockback. Its best modifier is Mythical. Rounding reveals that both the Mythical and Ruthless modifiers provide the same increase to damage, increasing it from 17 to 20.

=== Paints ===
Description: Paint is used to modify the color of objects. Nearly anything can be painted, including blocks, background walls, and furniture, along with non-collectable environment objects like trees, tall grass, flowers, and other ambient growth. Basic Paint is purchased from the Painter NPC. Two of the same color can be combined at a Dye Vat to create "Deep" color versions, which apply their color more vividly and are required in order to paint certain objects. Paint is applied to blocks and furniture with the Paintbrush, and to walls with the Paint Roller, with each tile consuming one bucket of Paint. The Paint Sprayer will automatically paint items when placing them. Paint can be removed with the Paint Scraper, although it will never be retrieved upon doing so. Destroying a painted block will not drop the Paint item either. Paint can occupy the player's ammo inventory space. If more than one color is present in the player's inventory, the color in the earliest inventory slot is used first (starting from the ammo inventory space, then proceeding from the top-left slot). Coatings are a special type of paint-like item. They function identically to normal paint in all ways except that coatings and paint can be applied to a block to combine their color and effect. Additionally, coatings can co-exist with each other. Paints and Dyes are not available on the Nintendo 3DS version, due to the unavailability of pixel shaders. The basic Paint is purchased from the Painter for 25 per bucket (except Shadow Paint (50), Negative Paint (75), Illuminant Coating (2), and Echo Coating (2). The following tools can be used to apply or remove paint: In addition, the Paint Sprayer accessory allows automatically applying paint to placed blocks, walls, and objects. It can be purchased from the Traveling Merchant.

The explosive projectile does 48 / 56 base damage, twice the listed damage of the weapon. The Onyx Blaster is a direct upgrade to the Shotgun. It can be crafted before defeating any of the mechanical bosses. Its best modifier is Unreal.

=== Capes ===
Description: Capes are accessories purchased from the Traveling Merchant, usually for 5 each. They are considered vanity items, as they provide no stats or bonuses. The Hunter Cloak is an anomaly; it can be sold by the Clothier for 15 if the player has accumulated a golf score of 2000, or by the Traveling Merchant regardless of golf score.


=== Magic Droppers ===
Description: Magic Droppers are items used to place "droplets" — dripping liquid effects on ceilings. Once placed, they permanently display an intermittent dripping effect. The effect is purely visual, and has no functional use. Magic Droppers are crafted with an Empty Dropper at Water, Lava, or Honey, with the Crystal Ball nearby. To apply the effect to a block, click the area just below that block. Droppers do not require any form of ammunition or liquid to use once crafted. Droplets can be removed by mining them with a pickaxe (no item drops when they are removed). Droplets are also naturally generated in random areas on world generation. They spawn below ceilings that have their corresponding liquid above them, as though that liquid were "leaking through". Natural droplets can be mined just like the player-placed version, and similarly drip indefinitely until removed by a player.

=== Red Envelope ===
Description: The Red Envelope is a removed unimplemented item that was intended to drop from all enemies during the Chinese New Year event. It was a grab bag item, meaning that it would have given the player various items upon opening it.


=== Pressure Plates ===
Description: Pressure Plates are activation mechanisms that trigger wired mechanisms when stepped on. A pressure plate's color determines which characters can trigger it. Pressure plates can be purchased from a Mechanic or taken from a natural source since the Red, Brown, Gray, Orange and Lihzahrd pressure plates are randomly generated on the map during world creation as the trigger for traps. Pressure plates only take up very small space on top of blocks, so they may be difficult to spot. The color of naturally spawned pressure plates is dependent on the color of the block it is generated on top of. They should be approached with caution as each one is (usually) connected to a trap mechanism. The Mechanic sells all types, except for Lihzahrd Pressure Plates, which have their distinct color of brown to blend in with Lihzahrd Bricks, and the Weighted Pressure Plates, which are crafted. The Teal Pressure Pad is a special kind of pressure plate that responds to projectiles impacting it and from pets touching it. Unlike regular pressure plates, the Teal Pressure Pad can be placed on the floor, ceiling, sidewall, and on platforms. The Weighted Pressure Plates activate when stepped on and when stepped off, useful in some applications. The Red, Green, Gray, Brown, Blue, Yellow, and Orange pressure plates can be bought from the Mechanic for 50 each, and the Teal Pressure Pad can be bought from the Mechanic for 2 each.

Description: The Christmas Tree is a decorative furniture item purchased from Santa Claus for 25. The Christmas Tree can be decorated with the Toppers, Garlands, Bulbs and Lights, that alter its appearance. Decorations can be placed on a Christmas Tree. There are 4 types of decoration and each tree may only have one of each type.

=== Spelunker Potion ===
Description: The Spelunker Potion is a buff potion that grants the Spelunker buff when consumed, which illuminates valuable nearby objects. The highlight color varies between versions. This lasts for 5 minutes, but can be canceled at any time by right-clicking the icon ( ), by selecting the icon and canceling it in the equipment menu ( ), by double-tapping the buff icon ( ), or by canceling the buff from the buffs screen (). It has a small chance to appear as a bonus drop from Slimes. The Spelunker buff illuminates the following: On all versions but the Old-gen console version, ore and other treasures will be displayed with a yellow tint. This will somewhat alter the natural color of the highlighted treasure, such as making Cobalt turquoise and Orichalcum red. Some ores are not affected, these being Crimtane (unlike its counterpart Demonite), Meteorite, Obsidian, and Hellstone. Meteorite and Crimtane, however, do provide their own light. In the Old-gen console version, every type of ore will be displayed in a specific color and will glow and flash:

=== Mythril Pickaxe ===
Description: The Mythril Pickaxe is a Hardmode pickaxe and is the pickaxe alternative to the Mythril Drill, having a slower mining speed but longer range and benefiting from mining speed bonuses.

It requires 15 Mythril Bars to craft (60 Mythril Ore) Its best modifier is Legendary. While Light may seem to provide a better speed boost by percentages, rounding reveals that Legendary and Light mine at equal speeds for this tool.

=== Christmas lights ===
Description: Christmas lights are decorative light sources that resemble Christmas string lights and emit very dim light. They can be placed on all four sides of blocks, and can be toggled with wires. Although too dim to serve as functional light sources, they will fulfill a House's light source requirement. Christmas lights are purchased from Santa Claus for 5. Christmas lights are available in three colors that are each sold separately.


=== Furnace ===
Description: The Furnace is a crafting station used mainly to smelt ores into bars, to create ore bricks, and to craft Glass and certain glass items from Sand, but can also be used to craft other items e.g. weapons. It is also a light source. The Furnace smelts all Pre-Hardmode ores besides Hellstone, which must be smelted in a Hellforge. The Furnace is also sold by the Merchant when he is in the Jungle biome.

=== Beds ===
Description: Beds are furniture items which allow the player to set a new spawn point, or to sleep, which makes time pass 5 times faster, and gives a boost to health regeneration, similar to chairs and sofas. Beds fulfill the chair requirement for the purposes of housing. Beds have two separate sections which can be interacted with via ⚷ Interact. Interacting with the head of a bed causes the player to enter the bed and sleep. Interacting with the foot half of a bed, when it is placed in a valid House, changes the player's spawn point. Like most other furniture, the direction a bed is placed in depends on the direction the player is facing when placing it. There are currently 35 / 27 craftable beds and 5 that can be acquired from the environment. All beds are functionally identical, and differ only in appearance. If the player hovers the cursor over the bed it will produce Sleeping Icon. Pressing ⚷ Interact on the head of a bed causes the player to lie down and sleep (indicated by their eyes closing), which accelerates time by five times its normal rate (1 hour of in-game time, which would usually take 1 minute of real-life time, takes only 12 seconds while sleeping). This affects game time, including watches, the sun and moon, plant growth, and background animations (but not buff timers, NPC movement or other animations). Pressing ⚷ Interact on the foot of a bed, when it is placed in a valid house, sets the player's spawn point to that bed. This is signified by the status message "Spawn point set!" When the same is done on a bed that has already been set as the player's spawn point, the status message "Spawn point removed!" is shown, and the player's spawn point is set back to the world's default. For a bed to function properly as a spawn point, it must be in a valid house. Other than the bed itself, no other furniture or lighting is required. There must also be clear space at the head of the bed for the player to stand. A bed may be placed in a non-rectangular room, as long as the leftmost 3 tiles immediately above it are left clear. For example: There may be a bed (4×2) surrounded by blocks on the left, right, and bottom, and above the foot of the bed, as long as there is space for the player to spawn at the head of the bed. The top-left 3 tiles just above the bed are clear. The mirror image of this arrangement is also valid.

=== Water fountains ===
Description: Water fountains are mechanisms that change the color of all nearby water. They can be activated via ⚷ Interact or wire. There are currently 10 / 8 different obtainable fountains, all of which are purchased from the Witch Doctor for 4 each at any time. On the Old-gen console version, Windows Phone version, and Nintendo 3DS versions, they are able to be purchased for free, but are only available after Plantera has been defeated. When measured from the edges of the sprite, the range of a Fountain is 60 tiles horizontally and 53 tiles vertically.


=== Solutions ===
Description: Solutions are type of ammunition that is used by Clentaminator and Terraformer. Each solution can convert blocks and walls to the blocks/walls of the respective biome. There are 8 / 5 types of solutions, 7 / 4 of which are sold by Steampunker under special conditions and one of them is sold by Truffle. Steampunker and Truffle do not sell solutions in Don't dig up and Get fixed boi worlds. The conversions of each solution are listed below:[1]


=== Butcher's set ===
Description: The Butcher's set is a Hardmode vanity set that consists of the Butcher Mask, Butcher's Bloodstained Apron and Butcher's Bloodstained Pants. It is dropped by the Butcher during the Solar Eclipse event.


=== Deadly Sphere Staff ===
Description: The Deadly Sphere Staff is a Hardmode, post-Plantera summoning weapon that summons a Deadly Sphere minion. Like other minions, the summoned Deadly Sphere is invincible and follows the player for an unlimited amount of time, unless the player dies, summons a replacement minion, cancels the buff, or leaves the world. It attacks by charging at enemies to inflict contact damage. It cannot move through blocks. The Deadly Sphere Staff has a 2.5% / 4.94% (1/40 / 79/1600) chance to drop from Deadly Sphere during a Solar Eclipse. Its best modifier is Ruthless. The Mythical modifier provides the widest array of stat bonuses, but these primarily affect the initial summon rather than the resulting minion. Additionally, minions cannot deal critical hits. The only lasting advantage a Mythical Deadly Sphere Staff has over a Ruthless one is knockback.


=== Fisherman's Pocket Guide ===
Description: The Fisherman's Pocket Guide is an informational accessory that displays the current Fishing Power. This accessory can be received as a 3.33*1/30 (3.33%) [1] / 2.5*1/40 (2.5%) chance reward for completing Fishing quests for the Angler NPC. On the PC version, Console version, Mobile version, and tModLoader version, the Angler will not give you a Fisherman's Pocket Guide as a reward if you already have one in your inventory or in any of your Portable Storages. However, if you have a Fisherman's Pocket Guide, Weather Radio, and Sextant (or at least one of the accessories crafted from them: the Fish Finder, PDA, or Cell Phone) in your inventories, he will be able to give you duplicate Fisherman's Pocket Guides.[1]

In The Constant seed, it will instead cancel out the screen effect, granting the player normal visuals. The accessory functions in both the ordinary inventory slots and vanity accessory slots. It is dropped by the Deerclops with a 33.33*1/3 (33.33%) chance.

=== Monster Meat ===
Description: The Monster Meat is a pet-summoning item which summons a Pig Man pet that follows the player around. It can be dropped from most Corruption/Crimson enemies with a 0.07*1/1500 (0.07%) chance. On The Constant seed, the drop rate is increased to a 0.2*1/500 (0.2%) chance.


=== Palm Wood armor ===
Description: Palm Wood armor is an Armor set that consists of the Palm Wood Helmet, Palm Wood Breastplate, and Palm Wood Greaves. Making this armor set requires the player to chop down Palm Trees, which can grow naturally in the Ocean and Oasis biomes or be manually planted using Acorns on Sand Blocks. Like the other Wood armor sets, it is fairly weak, and only useful very early on. It does provide a one defense bonus over the normal Wood armor, meaning if the player comes across the Oasis early on, it may be a wise idea to chop down Palm Trees to make this armor set as a minor upgrade. Wearing a full set grants a basic 3 defense plus a set bonus of 1 defense, which equals a total of 4 defense.

=== Copper Axe ===
Description: The Copper Axe is the first axe the player will obtain, and is weaker than the Iron or Lead Axe. It has an alternate ore version, the Tin Axe, which is slightly stronger. The Copper Axe is now used to craft the Axe of Regrowth in 1.4.4.Newly created characters will spawn with this item in their third inventory slot. Like all axes, it is used to cut down trees, cacti and giant glowing mushrooms. Alternately, it can be purchased from the Merchant for 4. Its best modifier is Light for harvesting purposes and either Agile or Forceful/Strong for combat purposes, due to its unusually low base damage. Though it can obtain the Ruthless modifier, the reduced knockback may be undesirable for early stages of the game.

=== Campfires ===
Description: The Campfire is a placed furniture item that emits light and provides the Cozy Fire health regeneration buff to players in its vicinity. A Campfire can be turned off by pressing the ⚷ Interact on the object or by sending it a wire signal, and can be toggled back on again the same way. It is also used to cook a Marshmallow on a Stick. The Cozy Fire buff increases nearby players' current healing rate by 10%, and adds an additional constant 0.5 health-per-second. The buff is applied to any players standing within a rectangular area of 169×125[1] () / 100×84 () tiles centered on the Campfire, similar to the Heart Lantern. The regeneration buffs from both items will stack together to provide a greater regeneration boost, and being within range of these items can also help to counteract the effects of damaging debuffs (such as Poisoned and On Fire!). The Fireplace operates similarly and provides the same Cozy Fire buff, but cannot cook a Marshmallow on a Stick.

=== Bunny License ===
Description: The Bunny License is a consumable item that can be purchased from the Zoologist for 5 after filling out 45% (243 entries) of the Bestiary. Using it allows a Town Bunny to move into town the next morning. Upon use, the status message "The license teleports away to the bunny delivery service..." is displayed. Upon additional uses, the status message "Pet exchange: Successful!" is displayed.


=== Minecarts ===
Description: Minecarts are mounts that allow players to ride on Minecart Tracks. There are currently 27 / 1 different Minecarts. On PC, Console, Mobile, Old Chinese, tModLoader, and tModLoader Legacy, Minecarts need to be equipped in the Minecart equipment slot, overriding the use of the Wooden Minecart. On Old-gen console, Windows Phone, and 3DS, the ordinary Minecart is the default and it cannot be changed. When the player is near a Minecart Track, pressing the Quick Mount hotkey or pressing the ⚷ Interact key on a point on the track causes a Minecart to spawn, which the player is automatically placed in. Once inside, the ▶ Right and ◀ Left direction keys either accelerate, decelerate, or reverse the cart's movement. The cart will maintain its current speed and direction if no keys are pressed and no obstacles are reached. The cart can also "jump" with the ↷ Jump key. To exit the Minecart (which causes the Minecart to despawn), the player can use a hook, press the Quick Mount hotkey, or cancel the buff ( right-clicking the icon, selecting the icon and canceling it in the equipment menu, double-tapping the icon, or canceling the buff from the buffs screen). The Minecart will also despawn if the player jumps off the tracks, lands on blocks, and attempts to move sideways. Upon colliding with an enemy, the minecart will deal damage to it and knock it back. See Notes for details. Upon using a Minecart Upgrade Kit, all minecarts equipped thereafter will gain a significant speed boost and be equipped with a laser that will fire at nearby enemies. This effect can be toggled on and off through a probe icon next to the minecart slot. Weapons and tools, as well as most other items except hooks, can be used while riding a Minecart.


=== Bathtubs ===
Description: The Bathtub is a decorative furniture item. It fulfills a house's requirement of a flat-surface item. There are currently 40 / 32 Bathtub types, all being functionally identical but presenting different appearances.

=== Wings ===
Description: Wings are Hardmode (with the exception of Fledgling Wings) accessories that can allow the player to fly temporarily by pressing and holding the ↷ Jump key. Flight time is reset when the player rests on solid objects, including both standing on blocks and using climbing items like Ropes, Hooks, Shoe Spikes, Climbing Claws, and Tiger Climbing Gear/Master Ninja Gear. Certain wings also allow the player to hover at fixed heights by holding the ▼ Down key during flight, and/or accelerate their ascent speed by holding the ▲ Up key. After flight time has been exhausted, a player can continue holding the ↷ Jump key to glide. Gliding fall speed can be accelerated by holding the ▼ Down key in addition. Wings additionally grant immunity from fall damage (except when overridden by the Stoned debuff, which nullifies fall damage protection items like the Lucky Horseshoe.) Flight is much more controlled with wings than with Rocket Boots, Spectre Boots, etc. alone, and they allow for much greater flight range. Equipping wings generally replaces jumps entirely with flight, rather than requiring a double-jump to activate. However, the wings stack with the flight of Rocket Boots and its upgrades. Double-jump accessories like the Cloud in a Bottle will still grant an additional jump, which is used after all flight time. There are currently 47 unique wing types in total: 45 are available on PC, Console, Mobile, and tModLoader, 39 on tModLoader Legacy, and 21 on Old-gen console, Windows Phone, and 3DS. Flight time and speed can vary by the version. Wings have a variety of origins: Some can be crafted, a few can be purchased outright, one is an Angler reward, a few are dropped directly from bosses, and Fledgling Wings are gifted to every new Journey Mode character or found in Skyware Chests and Sky Crates/Azure Crates In Expert Mode, more wings can come as part of Treasure Bags: Each Hardmode Treasure Bag has a 5*1/20 (5%) chance to drop a random set of developer items, and all sets include wings (with the exception of Aaron's set). Most craftable wings are crafted at a Hardmode Anvil: Most require 20 Souls of Flight and a core item determining the wing type. This core item can be a rare enemy drop with no other use (Such as the Giant Harpy Feather for the Harpy Wings), or a quantity of material representing a new stage of the game(Such as Shroomite Bars for the Hoverboard). The four lunar wings (Solar Wings, Vortex Booster, Nebula Mantle, and Stardust Wings) are instead crafted like other endgame equipment: At the Ancient Manipulator from Luminite Bars and Lunar Fragments; they do not require Souls of Flight. All wings can be sold for 8, except for the Leaf Wings (30 / 20 ), Steampunk Wings (60 / 20 ) and Fledgling Wings (4).


=== Glass ===
Description: Glass is a block and an ingredient primarily used to make decorative furniture, or other, essential items like Bottles. It can be acquired by smelting two pieces of sand at a Furnace, and is frequently used in building to represent things such as windows or mirrors.

Each boss has a 14.29*1/7 (14.29%) chance to drop its own mask. Masks provide no armor but if they are put in the head armor slot they seem to keep armor set bonuses.


=== Palladium armor ===
Description: Palladium armor is a Hardmode armor set crafted from Palladium Bars. It is the alternative to Cobalt armor. Like many Hardmode armor sets, Palladium armor has three different headpiece options, allowing players to focus on magical, melee, or ranged combat. With the full set equipped, successful attacks trigger the Rapid Healing buff, which heals 2 / 3 HP/s (12 / 15 health over 5 seconds). Further attacks will refresh the duration. The buff is not canceled if the armor is removed. It can be canceled manually by right-clicking the buff icon. Crafting a one-headpiece set requires 54 Palladium Bars, or 162 Palladium Ore. Crafting all five pieces requires 78 Palladium Bars, or 234 Palladium Ore.

Description: The Shadewood Bow is the bow crafted using Shadewood. It is the Crimson equivalent of the Ebonwood Bow. Its best modifier is Demonic, as it does not have any knockback and thus cannot get modifiers that affect it.

The type of key mold that is dropped depends on the biome the player is currently in (Jungle, Corruption, Crimson, Hallow, or Snow). On the PC, Console, Mobile, Old Chinese, tModLoader, and tModLoader Legacy versions, Biome Keys drop instead of Key Molds, and all existing Key Molds will change into their respective Keys if any exist in the world.

=== Rotten Egg ===
Description: Rotten Eggs are consumable ranged weapons obtained commonly from Goodie Bags, which are dropped during the Halloween season, and from shaking trees during that time. They explode on impact, with no chance of being retrieved. Rotten Eggs are unique in that they are one of the only player-wielded weapons that can damage friendly NPCs by default (the Clothier and Guide Voodoo Dolls allow killing their respective NPCs, but are not wielded as weapons). They are a slow but effective way of killing NPCs.


=== Rubblemaker ===
Description: The Rubblemaker is a tool used to place ambient objects rubble using items from the player's inventory. It is sold by the Goblin Tinkerer in Hardmode for 25. By pressing the ⚷ Interact button, the Rubblemaker can toggle between three placement sizes: Small, Medium, and Large. The Small setting corresponds to one tile-wide rubble, the Medium setting to two tile-wide rubble, and the Large setting to three tile-wide rubble. Rubble within each setting can be cycled through using the ▲ Up and ▼ Down buttons. The material which is highest and furthest to the left in the player's inventory will be prioritized, and only that material's rubble will be placeable until another supersedes it. Rubble objects are listed in the order in which the game cycles through them. Pressing the ▼ Down button advances the cycle forward.[1] An unused array of textures for the Tile ID 653 and a list of accompanying items the Rubblemaker would consume to place them can be found in the game's files. The name of the method in which the latter is stored, ForModders_AddPotsToWand(), indicates that the unused rubble recipes were left behind for modders or future updates. All of the textures are identical to the various types of pots which naturally generate in worlds; nearly every pot would be placed by an item found in the biome in which it generates.[3]


=== Meat Grinder ===
Description: The Meat Grinder is a Hardmode crafting station used to craft Flesh Blocks and Lesion Blocks. It has a 0.5*1/200 (0.5%) chance of being dropped by several Corruption () / Crimson enemies.

Description: The Goat Skull is a Hardmode mount-summoning item dropped by the Wall of Flesh in Master Mode with a 25*1/4 (25%) chance to drop. When used, it summons a rideable Goat Mount which allows the mounted player to perform a double jump, similar to the Cloud in a Bottle. Once a high speed is reached, the Goat Mount leaves a fire trail behind, and from that point on, it will be able to damage enemies on contact. The invulnerability is granted for 1/10th of a second when the player and the Goat Mount dash through an enemy, much like the brief invulnerability after taking damage.


=== Cobalt Bar ===
Description: Cobalt Bars are bars crafted from 3 Cobalt Ore. Cobalt is the first tier of the three Hardmode ores that the player is able to obtain. Cobalt is the equivalent of Palladium. When the first Demon Altar is broken, Cobalt or Palladium is chosen randomly and the other one will not spawn naturally in that world.

=== Drill Containment Unit ===
Description: The Drill Containment Unit (often called DCU) is a late-game post-Moon Lord mount that summons a Drill Mount, a rideable, flying vehicle that mines blocks extremely fast via lasers. It is currently the fastest controllable way to mine. It can fly and hover indefinitely, and has a mining range of 15 tiles. The Drill Mount flies at 41 mph vertically, 31 mph horizontally, and 51 mph diagonally. It mines all mineable blocks, including furniture and background objects, Trees, Lihzahrd Bricks, Altars (Hardmode), and Shadow Orbs / Crimson Hearts, among others. Background Walls remain intact but can be destroyed with the alternative key/button for the DCU . Crafting the Drill Containment Unit requires a total of 160 Luminite (requires defeating Moon Lord at least twice), 600 / 720 Chlorophyte Ore, 600 Glowing Mushrooms, 20 Ectoplasm, 120 each of Hellstone and Meteorite ores, and 40 Obsidian. This also requires four different crafting stations: A Hardmode Forge for the Chlorophyte and Spectre Bars, an Autohammer for the Shroomite Bars, an Ancient Manipulator for the Luminite Bars, and a Hardmode Anvil for the Drill Containment Unit itself. Because the Drill Mount also slopes blocks as it mines, the number of blocks that are mined will vary. The table below assumes that five of its lasers are mining, and the sixth laser is sloping. If four lasers are mining, it can mine 60 Dirt Blocks per second.

=== Beetle armor ===
Description: Beetle Armor is a Hardmode, post-Golem armor set that provides melee and defensive bonuses. Though it is crafted from Turtle armor, it trades away the Thorns effect in exchange for stronger offensive or defensive bonuses (depending on which chest piece is worn). It is the final melee armor set available on the Old-gen console version, Windows Phone version, and Nintendo 3DS version. On the PC version, Console version, Mobile version, Old Chinese version, tModLoader version, and tModLoader 1.3-Legacy version, it is the penultimate melee only armor set followed by Solar Flare armor. Beetle armor has two variants for its chest piece; Beetle Scale Mail and Beetle Shell. The Beetle Scale Mail enhances damage output and is slightly more agile, whereas the Beetle Shell provides more defense. Beetle armor provides the following bonuses when fully equipped: Crafting the full set with one chest piece requires 18 Beetle Husks and a full set of Turtle armor (54 Chlorophyte Bars (or 324 pieces of Chlorophyte Ore), and 3 Turtle Shells). Crafting all four pieces from scratch requires 26 Beetle Husks, 78 Chlorophyte Bars (or 468 pieces of Chlorophyte Ore), and 4 Turtle Shells.

=== Tiki armor ===
Description: Tiki armor is a Hardmode post-Plantera armor set purchased from the Witch Doctor for 150 in total. A full set of Tiki armor provides the following benefits: As of 1.4.4.9, Tiki Armor offers +20% whip range and +5 defense compared with Spooky armor's +28% minion damage and +20% movement speed (on Spooky has one less minion slot). The extra damage with whip, minions, and sentries makes Spooky generally stronger, but in a fight where the extra distance and defense is more important, Tiki may still play a role. Spooky's movement boost does not apply to mounts. Post-Moon Lord Stardust armor is superior to either. With the right buffs and accessories, a total of 10 minions can be summoned (see tips section below).


=== Potted Crystal Plants ===
Description: Potted Crystal Plants are placeable furniture items. They are purchased from the Princess for 10 each.


=== Coin Gun ===
Description: The Coin Gun is a Hardmode ranged weapon that uses coins as ammunition, which cannot be retrieved once fired. Its damage and velocity depend on the type of coin fired. It is dropped very rarely (0.025*1/4000 (0.025%) / 0.0125*1/8000 (0.0125%) chance) by regular Pirate Invasion enemies, excluding the Parrot. Its drop chance from Pirate Captain is quadrupled (0.1*1/1000 (0.1%) / 0.05*1/2000 (0.05%) chance), and increased again from the Flying Dutchman (2*1/50 (2%) / 0.25*1/400 (0.25%) chance). The Coin Gun cannot be reforged, and therefore cannot have modifiers. The Coin Gun cannot receive any modifiers that increase damage, so the modifier that boosts its DPS the most is Agile (+12% speed[1], +3% critical strike chance). Zealous (+5% critical strike chance) serves as the most ammo-efficient option, dealing the highest amount of damage per coin fired.

=== Treasure Bag ===
Description: Treasure Bags are consumable items obtained in Expert Mode and Master Mode as a reward for defeating bosses. Its contents depend on the boss it comes from. It is opened by either right-clicking it inside the inventory or using it while it is in your hand. In multiplayer, each player that deals damage to the boss receives one Treasure Bag upon completion. Treasure Bags are client-side and will despawn upon exiting the world. Each Treasure Bag contains the boss's usual drops from normal mode, along with one Expert Mode-exclusive item (orange-highlighted items below) – with the exception of the Lunatic Cultist, Dark Mage, Betsy, and Ogre, who currently do not provide an Expert mode-exclusive item. Hardmode bosses' Treasure Bags additionally have a 5% chance to contain one random set of developer items (except for Queen Slime). Expert mode-exclusive items all have the 12* rarity, with the exception of 0x33's Aviators. Each Treasure Bag has an internal rarity, despite being Expert items, which always have a 12* rarity. In addition to the above, all Treasure Bags from Hardmode bosses (except Queen Slime's) have a 5% chance to contain a random set of developer items, meaning that each set has a 0.28% chance of being in a Hardmode boss Treasure Bag. Obtaining a Treasure Bag in an Expert world, then opening the bag in a Normal world will retain the Treasure Bag's chance to yield developer items.

When attacking using ⚒ Use / Attack, the lance will extend, and holding ⚒ Use / Attack will keep it extended at a fixed angle. The damage will increase depending on the player's movement speed, making mounts, sprinting accessories, or dash abilities (such as those granted by Shield of Cthulhu, Tabi/Master Ninja Gear, or Solar Flare armor) useful for maximizing damage. When the player takes damage, the Shadow Jousting Lance will stop being active. Its best modifier is Godly or Demonic. Both modifiers increase the average damage output by the same amount.

The Clairvoyance buff can be refreshed limitlessly, with no cooldown period or restrictions on use. The Crystal Ball is not equipable in an accessory slot, and must be placed instead in order to activate the buff. It can be mined with a pickaxe or drill and picked up again, even while the buff is active, which will not cancel the buff.


=== Hornet Staff ===
Description: The Hornet Staff is a pre-Hardmode summon weapon. It spawns a hornet minion that follows the player and attacks enemies with a ranged stinger attack, similar to the Hornet enemy's attack. The stingers travel in a straight line, do not pierce, and inflict the Poisoned debuff for 4–7 seconds. Like other minions, the summoned Hornet is invincible and follows the player for an unlimited amount of time, unless the player dies, summons a replacement minion, cancels the buff, or leaves the world. Its best modifier is Ruthless. The Mythical modifier provides the widest array of stat bonuses, but these primarily affect the initial summon rather than the resulting minion. Additionally, minions cannot deal critical hits. The only lasting advantage a Mythical Hornet Staff has over a Ruthless one is knockback.

Description: Gemspark Blocks are blocks that glow. The color of the glow depends on the gem used to craft the block. They are also considered mechanisms, as their glow can be toggled by wiring them to a trigger. Gemspark Blocks are crafted from Gems and Glass at a Work Bench. Gemspark Blocks will also color and add a glowing effect to Waterfalls. This requires hammering a Gemspark Block so that water flows over it. When the Gemspark Block is in its active state, the resulting waterfall will take on the color of the Gemspark block, and will glow for its entire length. Glowing waterfalls emit a very faint light onto other objects. Gemspark Blocks will not change the color of Lavafalls or Honey.

=== Money Trough ===
Description: The Money Trough is a summoning item that summons the Flying Piggy Bank, a temporary floating winged version of the Piggy Bank. It has a 0.5*1/200 (0.5%) / 1*1/100 (1%) chance to drop from the Drippler and the Blood Zombie during a Blood Moon, or with a much lower (0.03*1/4000 (0.03%) / 0.05*1/2000 (0.05%)) chance from their statue-spawned versions (regardless of whether a Blood Moon is occurring). It also has a 6.67*1/15 (6.67%) chance of dropping from the Zombie Merman and Wandering Eye Fish, which can be fished up during a Blood Moon. The Money Trough enables players to access their Piggy Bank contents without having to place the Piggy Bank or any furniture for it to rest on. The Flying Piggy Bank despawns after 3 minutes, but can be re-summoned repeatedly at no cost. The Flying Piggy Bank does not follow the player like pets or minions would, instead it hovers stationary at the point summoned. Once summoned, other players may use it as well to access their own Piggy Bank.

It can be used as bait and along with the other golden bait critters has a bait power of 50%, the highest usable value among bait (along with the Master Bait), excluding the Truffle Worm.

=== Iron Ore ===
Description: Iron Ore is an early-game ore that generates upon world creation on the Surface, as well as in the Underground and Cavern layers. Its primary use is in crafting Iron Bars, which can then be used to craft the Iron tier of tools, weapons, and armor, as well as Buckets, Chains, and several other items. The equivalent of Iron Ore is Lead Ore, which will sometimes replace Iron in a world. Iron Ore has a small chance to appear as a bonus drop from slimes. Furthermore, it can be obtained from all types of crates. As Iron Bars are needed to create an Iron Anvil, Iron Ore must usually be obtained before any weapons or armor can be created out of metal bars. While this can be circumvented by purchasing an Iron Anvil from the Merchant, that is generally inefficient, as it is not difficult to find 15 Iron Ore early on in the game.

They are always destroyed on impact, and have a noticeably higher velocity than other arrows. They can be found in Shadow Chests and Pots in The Underworld, crafted at an anvil, or purchased from the Demolitionist for 1 each, once the Wall of Flesh has been defeated.

=== Liquid bombs ===
Description: Liquid bombs are explosive items which either place or remove liquids instead of solid blocks when exploding. There are four different types of liquid bombs: Dry Bomb, Wet Bomb, Lava Bomb, and Honey Bomb. When a liquid bomb is used, it will be tossed onto the ground and explode after a 3-second fuse, applying its special effect (see below). If, however, the bomb touches any liquid, it will immediately explode and apply its effects. All liquid bombs deal damage to nearby players, enemies, and critters. Wet Bombs are obtainable by opening Obsidian or Hellstone Crates found by fishing in lava. If the player is carrying a Wet Bomb, the Demolitionist will sell Wet Bombs for 25 each. Purchasing more Wet Bombs will allow the player to craft the other variants (see below). The Demolitionist will also sell the three other types of bombs for the same price while the player is carrying them.

=== Ivy Chest ===
Description: The Ivy Chest is a chest storage item found only in Jungle Shrines and Living Mahogany Trees in the Underground Jungle. They are characterized by gray bricks and green torches. The Ivy Chest is the primary object for storing items, which means you won't lose any in case of death. The Ivy Chests needs a solid floor or a wooden flap before it can be placed. In total, the Ivy Chest has 40 (10 x 4) slots where items can be stored, but in order to be mined with a pickaxe, the chest must be completely empty. Each Ivy Chest will always contain one primary item, and can potentially contain multiple secondary items, or none at all. Besides one of the items listed here, they will also contain common items depending on the height they were found: Underground or Caverns.

=== Spooky armor ===
Description: Spooky armor is a Hardmode post-Plantera armor set made from Spooky Wood. Wearing the full set increases the wearer's minion capacity by 4 (to a total of 5), along with granting +58% minion damage and creating a glowing effect around the character. It requires a total of 750 [Spooky Wood] to create the full set. A full set of Spooky armor provides the following benefits: On Spooky armor's +28% minion damage and +11% movement speed is generally considered superior to Tiki armor's +20% whip range and +5 defense. Summoners who play an active role with a whip and will prefer Tiki over Spooky (such summoners would also chose Obsidian armor over Bee armor pre-hardmode). Post-Moon Lord, Stardust armor is superior to either. On Spooky armor has one less minion and 3 less defense. Without additional minion capacity accessories/buffs, this makes Tiki armor's minion damage slightly higher (130% × 5 = 650% vs. Spooky's 158% x 4 = 632%). Once an extra minion or sentry is summoned, Spooky armor increases minion damage by 790%, while Tiki armor only increases it by 780%. The more minions that can be summoned, the more damage minions do with Spooky armor. Spooky armor always increases whip damage more than Tiki. Spooky armor is both the strongest and most expensive armor that is crafted with a form of wood.

=== Nail ===
Description: The Nail is a type of ammunition used solely by the Nail Gun, attainable from a Nailhead during a Solar Eclipse.

=== Cobalt armor ===
Description: Cobalt armor is a Hardmode armor set crafted from Cobalt Bars and is the alternative to Palladium armor. Like many Hardmode ore-based armors, Cobalt armor has three different headpiece options, allowing players to focus on magical, melee, or ranged combat respectively, each changing the bonus applied for wearing a full set. A full set also grants a total of +3% critical hit chance and +10% movement speed / +3% damage, +5% critical hit chance and +10% movement speed, from its individual pieces. Wearing a full set causes the player to display an after-image effect while in motion, similar to the Ninja armor, Shadow armor, and Necro armor. Crafting a full set with a single headpiece requires 45 Cobalt Bars (135 Cobalt Ore). Crafting all five pieces requires a total of 65 Cobalt Bars (195 Cobalt Ore). This armor is not the same as the Ancient Cobalt armor set dropped by Jungle enemies; the latter is effectively reskinned Jungle armor, using the former sprites of this set.

=== Obsidian ===
Description: Obsidian is a unique pre-Hardmode ore which is created when Water and Lava collide, at which point it forms placed blocks of Obsidian which can be mined and collected. Though Obsidian is considered an ore and is gathered similarly, it has no bar form of its own (although it is used to craft Hellstone Bars). Mining Obsidian requires a pickaxe with at least 55% pickaxe power (the Gold Pickaxe and its counterpart, the Platinum Pickaxe, are the weakest pickaxes able to do so). Mining Obsidian requires a pickaxe with at least 65% pickaxe power (the Nightmare Pickaxe and its counterpart, the Deathbringer Pickaxe, are the weakest pickaxes able to do so). If the player lacks a viable pickaxe, Explosives can also be used to obtain Obsidian.

=== Platforms ===
Description: Platforms are a special type of block that can be walked on, but also allow movement through the space they occupy. The player normally stands and walks on platforms as if they were ordinary blocks, and they can move down through a platform by pressing the ▼ Down key while standing on one. Players can also walk or jump horizontally through the space occupied by platforms, only treating the platform as "solid" when landing on them from above. Walking enemies can similarly walk on or pass through platforms. Flying enemies like bats will fly up through them, but not down. Other enemies, including Harpies, ignore them entirely. NPCs will always climb up platforms. Weapons and their projectiles will travel through platforms. Liquids flow through platforms, and lava will destroy all platforms upon contact, with the exception of Obsidian and Stone Platforms. Gravity-affected blocks like Sand will be supported by platforms. Because of the high mobility provided by platforms, they can be used in a variety of ways: as a bridge across gaps that players can descend through without destroying, for roof access that keeps some enemies from getting through, or to create a fighting area above most enemies that players can fire down through while keeping out of reach. Also, since Piggy Banks, Chests, crafting stations and most other furniture can be placed on them like on ordinary blocks (exceptions include gems and Crystal Shards), they can be used as a shelving to pack furniture into a confined space without restricting player movement. A platform has four distinct positions, which can be cycled through by hitting it with a hammer, similarly to an ordinary block: A fourth hammer blow will cycle the platform back to its default position. Only one platform can occupy a single block tile, so there cannot be top and bottom platforms in the same tile. Stairs can face either direction, regardless of what side of a block they are on. Walking up stairs in the direction they face will raise the player as expected, but walking towards stairs facing away from the player will not have any effect. As with normal platforms, pressing ▼ Down will cause stairs to be ignored. Nothing can be placed on stairs. Smart Cursor can be used to place stairs without having to hammer the platforms into the correct state. On the Nintendo 3DS version, platforms are crafted from only one block of their respective type. Team Platforms are sold by the Traveling Merchant. Golden Platforms are dropped during the Pirate Invasion. All other noncraftable platforms are found in the Dungeon.

=== Frog ===
Description: The Frog is a background critter that primarily serves as environment flavor and spawns on the surface Jungle at any time. On PC, Console, Mobile, and tModLoader, they are able to swim at water surface. Due to them having only 5 HP and no defense, they are often killed instantly by enemies or the player itself. A Frog behaves like the other common ground critters - it moves around aimlessly as a bunny, penguin or squirrel would, until despawned or killed. Gold frogs have a 1/150 chance to spawn instead of the regular variant, and a 3.33*1/30 (3.33%) / 2*1/50 (2%) chance for a Mystic Frog to spawn instead. It can be caught with any Bug Net to be carried around in the inventory and released later, or crafted into a Frog Cage to be used as decorative furniture. Once crafted, the caged Frog cannot be released again, and when placed down it moves around inside the cage as it would do outside. The Bestiary entry for the Frog: "Prefers bodies of water filled with thick growth. Perfectly content both on land and underwater."

=== Molten Charm ===
Description: The Molten Charm is a pre-Hardmode accessory crafted from a Lava Charm and an Obsidian Skull, combining the effects of both items. When the Molten Charm is equipped and the player comes into contact with lava, a 7-second countdown begins, signified by a lava meter that displays over the player's head. It operates similarly to the Breath meter, but displays flame icons instead of bubbles. Lava immunity time is recharged gradually by exiting lava, the same way breathing time is recharged by exiting water (albeit much more slowly). The Molten Charm also grants immunity to the burning damage normally inflicted by contact with Meteorite, Hellstone, and Hellstone Brick. It does not grant immunity to other fire-based damage. The Molten Charm and the Magma Skull provide functionally identical effects, but are used to craft different items. The Molten Charm can be combined with the Water Walking Boots or the Obsidian Water Walking Boots to craft the Lava Waders.

=== Toilets ===
Description: Toilets are furniture items which can be placed on the ground. They are functionally similar to chairs, and count as comfort items for NPC house requirements. In combination with a Work Bench or a Table, they also form minor crafting stations. Only the Toilet and Golden Toilet are considered as a valid crafting station. Sitting on a toilet increases the player's fishing power by 5. Toilets act as mechanisms that can be activated via wire, which makes them appear to explosively eject sewage. This effect is purely a novelty visual. Ejected sewage on the ground fades after a few seconds. They can also be used to make poo by sitting on it with any tier of Well Fed active. The amount of poo dropped is based on the tier of the buff and its duration. There are currently 45 / 42 / 2 toilets.

=== Flare Gun ===
Description: The Flare Gun is a ranged weapon that provides a ranged method of illuminating areas. It fires Flares, Blue Flares, and Shimmer Flares, which provide light and stick to the blocks they hit. They also deal minimal damage, and inflict the On Fire! debuff. The Flare Gun is found randomly in Gold Chests underground. Flares travel in a slight arc and stick to blocks (similar to Sticky Glowsticks), but have greater velocity and range. They are waterproof, and can be fired into and out of water. Once fired, Flares emit low-level, flickering, tinted light (red or blue, depending on the type fired) that lasts for 10 minutes. They stick to the blocks they impacted and will function underwater. Flares cannot be recovered once they burn out. When held, the muzzle of the Flare Gun will continually emit a flare effect, as long as at least one Flare is in the player's inventory. The Flare Gun cannot be reforged, and therefore cannot have modifiers. Flares are used as ammunition for the Flare Gun. There are two variants that work identically, but do not stack together: Flares (red) and Blue Flares. They can be purchased from the Merchant for 7 each, while a Flare Gun is in the player's inventory. 25–50 red Flares are also found in Gold Chests that contain a Flare Gun. Both types of Flare deal the On Fire! debuff, causing the afflicted enemy or player to lose 4 health per second. There is a 66.67*2/3 (66.67%) chance that the debuff will last 5 seconds, and a 33.33*1/3 (33.33%) chance that it will last 10 seconds. There are currently 6 / 2 different types of Flares.

Description: Crimson Grass Wall is a type of wall. Like the Grass of the Crimson it has a sickly hue of red. On the PC version, Console version, Mobile version, and tModLoader version, it is sold by the Dryad during a Blood Moon. In all other versions, it can be destroyed, but not harvested, making it unobtainable as an item. Crimson Grass Walls cannot be placed by the player like many other walls, but it can be converted from Grass Walls, Flower Walls, and Jungle Walls (apparently both natural ones and those bought from the Dryad) by using Red Solution sprayed with the Clentaminator. As the Clentaminator affects a rather large area, creating areas of localized Crimson Grass Wall without converting blocks and other wall parts may be difficult. Crimson Grass Walls can spread The Crimson to nearby pure walls. See Biome spread for further information. Like its counterparts, this wall cannot be used for a house.


=== Fishing Bobbers ===
Description: The Fishing Bobbers are an accessories that provide a flat value of 10 your Fishing power when equipped. The Fishing Bobber is acquired as a 2.94*1/34 (2.94%)[1] chance reward for completing a Fishing quest for the Angler NPC. Using 5 Fallen Stars at a Tinkerer's Workshop, it can be crafted into a Glowing Fishing Bobber. The Angler will not give the player a Fishing Bobber as a reward if they already have one in their inventory, in any of their portable storage items or loadouts. However, if the player has all of Angler's fishing and informational accessories[2] (or their upgrades like the Angler Tackle Bag and Fish Finder) in their inventories, this rule will be ignored.[1]

=== Logic Gates ===
Description: A Logic Gate is a mechanism used to provide logic to wiring setups. Input is provided using a stack of Logic Gate Lamps placed on top of it. The logic gate turns on and off depending on its inputs, and emits a signal every time its state changes. The logic gates, along with the Logic Gate Lamps, are purchased from the Steampunker for 2 each. All gates are turned off when they are first placed. Whenever a lamp is added or removed or one of its lamps changes state, the logic gate updates according to the following rules: Whenever a logic gate is turned on or off it emits a signal. If this signal would cause a logic gate to change its own inputs and emit two signals on the same tick[1], instead a puff of smoke is shown at the gate and only one signal is emitted. Note that while only one signal is emitted, the state of the logic gate itself still changes. Placing a faulty logic gate lamp above a logic gate turns it blue, overriding its normal functionality and changing its behavior entirely. The logic gates function as a randomizer instead, and can no longer turn on or off. The gate no longer emits signals when normal logic lamps above it change state. Instead, when the faulty lamp is triggered by a signal, it randomly selects one of the logic lamps below it. If that lamp is on, the logic gate emits a signal. So, if there are three lamps below the faulty lamp, two ON and one OFF, the gate has a 2/3 chance to emit a signal when the faulty lamp is triggered. A faulty lamp can be triggered multiple times in one tick, effectively giving the gate multiple chances to emit a signal. Multiple signals cannot be emitted on the same tick this way, however, the gate will have a chance to emit a signal for every time a faulty lamp receives a signal. For example, if you trigger a faulty gate with one out of two of its logic gate lamps on twice in the same tick, it will have an 3/4 chance of emitting a signal. Faulty lamps continue to work if only one logic gate lamp is under it. In this case, the logic gate as a whole acts as an "if" statement, only passing a signal through if the single lamp is on. If no logic gate lamps are attached, the logic gate never sends signals when the faulty lamp is triggered. A very practical use of this is a one-way wire: when a logic gate receives a signal it does nothing, but triggering the faulty lamp above it does send a signal. The logic gate lamp under the faulty lamps needs to be on. Also, this wire can be turned off by sending a signal to the logic gate lamp. Making two of these lets the player control all four possible states of a wire: Off, on (A->B), on (A<-B), on (A<-->B). Since gates emit a signal whenever they either turn on or off, the "inverted" versions of each gate (those with an "N" prefix) behave identically to their normal counterparts in most situations. The only difference is when the first lamp is added to a new gate. (For example, both the NAND and AND gates start off when first placed. However, upon adding an off gate, the AND gate would stay off and emit no signal while the NAND gate would turn on, thus emitting a signal.) A toggle flip-flop is a device with one input and changes state every other input. The device consists of a faulty logic gate lamp, a logic gate lamp, and a gate. It is particularly useful when utilizing sensors to toggle activations without having the sensor's ending pulse turn off the device. A set/reset flip-flop is a device that has two inputs, and can be switched between the two. However, multiple activations on the same input will not change the state. It will output a pulse when the state changes. In the illustration, red and green are the inputs, and blue is the output. A circuit which can store an intermediate value. It has three inputs (at the top), write, read, and input, from left to right, and one output. It also has an internal bit-state that is not accessible from outside. While read is off, the internal bit will never change; while read is on, the internal bit will copy input. Independent of that, while write is off, the output will never change; while write is on, the output will copy the internal bit. The bit is the "or" logic gate next to the junction box (hammering). Simple switch to turn traps on/off. Uses two logic gates: AND (3 lamps), and XOR. Switch and pressure plate connected to XOR gate to reset AND gate after each use, so the trap would be activated every time the plate is triggered as long as the switch is not active.


=== Love Potion ===
Description: The Love Potion is a Hardmode thrown potion that functions similarly to Thrown Water, but inflicts no functional effect. Hitting a solid block will inflict all players, NPCs, enemies, and critters with the Lovestruck debuff, causing them to emit red hearts for 30 seconds, similar to the Water Gun's dripping. This effect is purely cosmetic.

=== Lightning Aura sentry summons ===
Description: The Lightning Aura Rod, Cane, and Staff are special sentry summon weapons. They can summon the Lightning Aura sentry, which lasts for 10 minutes / 2 minutes , remains stationary, and does not count against the player's minion capacity. Each Lightning Aura sentry is a circle of lightning aura centered on the base that damages enemies repeatedly as they go through it. It has a range of 17 tiles (1 tile is the center, and 8 in every direction). The Rod is sold by the Tavernkeep for 50000*5 , the Cane for 150000*15 , and Staff for 600000*60 . Lightning Aura weapons completely ignore enemy defenses by adding half the enemy's defense to the weapon's damage. The Lightning Aura Staff, for example, always inflicts around 34 damage on any enemy, regardless of its defense stat. This occurs before the defense drop from Ichor, Shark Tooth Necklace, or Stinger Necklace is taken into account, allowing them to benefit from the debuff/damage penetration. Lightning Aura weapons state tripled damage numbers in their tooltips as an estimate to reflect this unique ability. The Rod is always available. The Cane becomes available after defeating one Mechanical Boss, and the Staff becomes available after defeating Golem. The three different versions cause an identical effect, but with varying statistics, with the Staff being the most expensive and the most powerful. These weapons can only be used outside of the Old One's Army event after the event has been successfully completed. Completing the event on any difficulty allows Rods, Canes, and Staves alike to be used outside of the event. During the Old One's Army event, Etherian Mana can be collected, which allows the placement of multiple Lightning Auras that remain permanently until the event is over. Etherian Mana cannot be used outside the event. Lightning Aura sentries are boosted by the Monk armor and Shinobi Infiltrator armor set bonuses, which increase their attack rate (from 2 attacks per second to 2.4 attacks per second) and allow them to deal critical hits. The critical strike chance of these weapons will always be locked at 25% (Shinobi Infiltrator), or 16.7% (Monk), and will not be boosted by the weapon's modifier or any other boost to critical strike chance. The Shinobi Infiltrator armor also increases the size of the Lightning Aura summon. Its best modifier is Demonic or Deadly, as it does not have any knockback and thus cannot get modifiers that affect it. Demonic now gives 25% damage. Bringing the Tier 1 Rod to 5 damage.

=== Luminite Chainsaws ===
Description: Luminite Chainsaws are four tools, all of which have the same stats. The four types are the Solar Flare Chainsaw, Vortex Chainsaw, Nebula Chainsaw, and the Stardust Chainsaw, each themed after different Celestial Pillars. They are all unable to be crafted, and instead the player must craft the Luminite Hamaxes. Like all axes and chainsaws, they are used to cut down trees, cacti, and giant glowing mushrooms, so the best possible modifier is Godly. With current methods, it is impossible to hack these items into a character's inventory using external editors, as they will disappear from that character's inventory as soon as they load into a world.


=== Forbidden armor ===
Description: Forbidden armor is a Hardmode armor set consisting of the Forbidden Mask, Forbidden Robes, and the Forbidden Treads. Crafting the full set requires 3 Forbidden Fragments and 46 Titanium Bars or Adamantite Bars. A full set of Forbidden armor will provide the following stats: While wearing the full set, a golden, spiky, rune-like object, known as the Forbidden Sign, floats behind the player in a very similar fashion to the Stardust Guardian from the Stardust armor set. Double tapping ▼ Down or ▲ Up (depending on the "Activate Set Bonuses" setting) will send a beam of dust particles that summon a sand tornado at the nearest block surface beneath the cursor position at the cost of 20 mana. The beam itself does not deal any damage, but the tornado rapidly hits any enemy that comes in direct contact with it for 20 base damage. The Forbidden Sign also casts a faint yellow light around the player, similar to the Mining Helmet. The dust particles cannot pass through solid objects; if there is a solid object between the character and the cursor, the beam will hit the solid object, stop there, and the sand tornado will not be summoned. Only one sand tornado can be summoned at a time, and when a new tornado is summoned, the old one disappears after roughly 1 second. A space of at least 3×12 tiles is required for the tornado to be summoned. If no enemies come in contact with the tornado, it disappears after 15 seconds.[2]

=== Luminite Pickaxes ===
Description: Luminite Pickaxes are four Hardmode, post-Moon Lord endgame pickaxes. The four types are the Solar Flare Pickaxe, the Vortex Pickaxe, the Nebula Pickaxe and the Stardust Pickaxe. All types of Luminite pickaxes share the same stats. They are the alternate versions of the Luminite Drills, having a slower mining speed but longer range and benefiting from mining speed bonuses. These four pickaxes are the second-strongest mining tool in the game, each with 225% pickaxe power. The current strongest is the Laser Drill with 230% pickaxe power. They require Luminite and Lunar Fragments to craft, obtainable from the Moon Lord and Celestial Towers, respectively. Their best modifier is Legendary. While Light may seem to provide a better speed boost by percentages, rounding reveals that Legendary and Light mine at equal speeds for these tools.

=== Crystal Serpent ===
Description: The Crystal Serpent is a Hardmode magic weapon that is obtained by fishing in The Hallow in any layer. It fires a magical pink projectile that shatters into 3-5 smaller sparks upon impact with an enemy or solid block, each of which deals 80% base damage and knockback (32 base damage and a knockback of 3.52 (Weak)).[1] These sparks are affected by gravity and ricochet against solid blocks, lasting one second before disappearing. When fired at a one-block-thick wall, one of the splash projectiles has a chance of passing through to the other side. It is the Hallowed counterpart to the Corruption's Toxikarp and the Crimson's Bladetongue. Its best modifier is Mythical.

=== Toy Tank ===
Description: The Toy Tank is a mount-summon item that spawns a rideable Santa-NK1. It is dropped by the Santa-NK1 in Master Mode. The mount is notable for having a double jump as well as two auto-targeting weapons attached; a front-facing machine gun and a homing rocket launcher. The maximum movement speed of the mount is 41 mph, and it takes about 1.5 seconds to reach top speed. The maximum jump height is 12 blocks without a double jump, or 26 blocks with the double jump when timed right. The double jump can be stacked with other double jump accessories. The tank is 2 blocks wide and 3 blocks tall, making it easier to mine with than larger mounts such as The Black Spot. The two attached weapons target Enemies in a cone shaped area in front of the player up to 30 blocks away. The machine gun does around 80-120 damage on a normal hit. Combined with its fast rate of fire, that makes this mount a reliable weapon. The homing rockets do around 100-131 damage on a normal hit. Once shot from the tank, homing rockets seek the closest target, including targets that did not cause it to fire such as ones behind the player. The damage dealt does not scale with any modifiers the player has.


=== Capricorn set ===
Description: The Capricorn set is a vanity set consisting of the Capricorn Helmet, the Capricorn Chestplate, the Capricorn Hooves, and the Capricorn Tail.

=== Guide to Plant Fiber Cordage ===
Description: The Guide to Plant Fiber Cordage is an accessory that, when equipped, allows the player to collect Vine Rope when destroying vines.

This lasts for 5–15 minutes, but can be canceled at any time by selecting the icon and canceling it in the equipment menu () or by double-tapping the buff icon (). The only difference between the three potions is the duration of the Lucky buff. The Lucky buff is unique, however, in that its effect depends on the remaining duration. The Greater Luck Potion gives +0.3 luck for 5 minutes, followed by +0.2 luck for the next 5 minutes (the equivalent of a "regular" Luck Potion), and +0.1 luck for the final 5 minutes (the equivalent of the Lesser Luck Potion).

=== Bottomless Honey Bucket ===
Description: The Bottomless Honey Bucket is an item that functions similarly to the standard Honey Bucket, the only differences being that it never needs refilling (and cannot be filled), it can be used an infinite number of times, has a slightly extended range, and can place Honey slightly faster than a standard bucket (especially when moving the cursor around while filling). In pre-hardmode, there is a 1/2 (50%) chance that either it or a Honey Absorbant Sponge will be awarded as a quest reward when turning in a Bumblebee Tuna to the Angler. In Hardmode, one of the two items is guaranteed.


=== Golden Carp ===
Description: Golden Carp are a type of fish which are found extremely rarely by fishing in any biome on the Underground, Cavern and Underworld layers, with the exception of the Desert / an Ice biome that is Corrupted, Crimsoned, or Hallowed. Unlike most other fish, Golden Carp are not used for crafting. Instead, they have an extraordinarily high sell value of 10.


=== Ectoplasm ===
Description: Ectoplasm is a Hardmode post-Plantera crafting material dropped from Dungeon Spirits in the Dungeon. Dungeon Spirits drop 1–2 Ectoplasm upon death. It is used by Old-gen console, Windows Phone, and 3DS players to directly craft the Spectre armor and tools.

=== Blade Staff ===
Description: The Blade Staff is a Hardmode summon weapon that summons an Enchanted Dagger minion suspended above the player's head, attacking enemies within range by flying toward and through them repeatedly at a fast pace. Its attacks ignore 25 enemy defense, making it more effective against Hardmode enemies than its damage stat would indicate. (Including the ignored enemy defense, the Blade Staff's effective base damage is around 18.) On the PC version, Console version, Mobile version, and tModLoader version, the Blade Staff is dropped by Queen Slime with a drop rate of 25*1/4 (25%) / 33.33*1/3 (33.33%) Its best modifiers are Demonic, Deadly, Mystic, or Hurtful. Unlike most minions, the Enchanted Dagger deals no knockback, so the weapon cannot obtain the Ruthless modifier. Due to its low base damage, all damage-improving modifiers +10% or greater improve its damage by the same amount.


=== Bone Arrow ===
Description: The Bone Arrow is an arrow type purchased from the Skeleton Merchant for 15 each, during moon phases 1 (full), 2, 5 (new), and 6.

It is the Crimson variant of the Light's Bane, and as such can be used as a substitute for forging the Night's Edge. Although it is noticeably more damaging and larger than the Light's Bane, it attacks slower. The Blood Butcherer applies the Blood Butchered debuff, causing the afflicted enemy to emit a spurt of blood and lose 4 health per second for a 9 second duration. The damage the Blood Butchered debuff inflicts over time can be stacked additively to a single enemy for up to a maximum of five stacks, causing the afflicted enemy to lose up to 20 health per second with all five stacks of the debuff applied. Its best modifier is Legendary.

=== Egg Cannon ===
Description: The Egg Cannon is a ranged weapon that has a 50% chance to be dropped by Lepus. It uses bullets for ammo, but fires projectiles that resemble Suspicious Looking Eggs. Because of this, bullets like the Cursed Bullet have no effect on the resulting projectiles. The eggs have a small chance to spawn a Bunny (on a Blood Moon, a Corrupt Bunny) or a Bird on impact. They are also affected by gravity (no matter the ammo), but they can travel long distances. The Egg Cannon cannot be reforged, and therefore cannot have modifiers.


=== Candy Cane Pickaxe ===
Description: The Candy Cane Pickaxe is a third-tier pickaxe that has the same pickaxe power as the Gold Pickaxe, and therefore is capable of mining Demonite and Crimtane Ores. It is obtained from Presents dropped during the Christmas event, with a chance of 0.634% in pre-Hardmode and 0.592% in Hardmode. It has the same mining speed as the Gold Pickaxe, therefore it is a good replacement of all pickaxes below Platinum Pickaxe with the exception of the Bone Pickaxe. Its best modifier is Legendary. While Light may seem to provide a better speed boost by percentages, rounding reveals that Legendary and Light mine at equal speeds for this tool.


=== Orichalcum Waraxe ===
Description: The Orichalcum Waraxe is a Hardmode axe that is obtainable after crafting a Mythril Anvil or an Orichalcum Anvil, and is the axe alternative to the Orichalcum Chainsaw.

Like all other axes and chainsaws, it is solely used to cut down trees, cacti, and Giant Glowing Mushrooms. Its best modifier is Legendary.

=== Reflective Dye ===
Description: Reflective Dye is a type of dye that is randomly given to you when you give a Strange Plant to the Dye Trader NPC. When equipped, it will give the selected accessory/armor a "shiny" effect, reflecting the surrounding light around the player. The reflection is more pronounced the closer the player is to a light source. The dye will prioritize light from the sun when the player is outside. From some perspectives, the player may look 3D when this dye is equipped all over. As with other reflective dyes, this dye is not animated when standing still, but the shading on a dyed piece of equipment will change according to the surrounding light, giving it the appearance of light reflecting off of a shining metallic object.


=== Demon Bow ===
Description: The Demon Bow is a bow crafted solely using Demonite Bars. It is an upgrade over the Gold Bow and the Platinum Bow, being stronger and faster. The Demon Bow, along with its counterpart, the Tendon Bow, is the last type of ore bow the player will be able to craft until they reach The Underworld, as they could craft the Molten Fury.

Birds have only 5 health and no defense, and can be damaged by other enemies including the player, which almost always results in their instant death. They are found on the surface, where they are as common as a Bunny, often spawn in the morning, and can be heard singing when nearby. Much like the Vulture, Birds remain still until approached, whereupon they will fly away. Birds can be caught using the Bug Net to be carried around in the inventory and released later, crafted into a respective cage to be placed as an animated furniture item, or crafted into a Bird Statue, although a Bird cannot be released once crafted.

=== Asphalt Block ===
Description: Asphalt Blocks are unique hardmode blocks, craftable after at least one mechanical boss has been defeated, that dramatically increase the speed of players running along them, along with reducing the time it takes to stop running. Their acceleration stacks with other speed-boosting items such as the Hermes Boots and its derivative accessories. It only affects players running directly on it – the speed of Enemies, NPCs and Critters will remain unaffected. Immediately after jumping or falling off of Asphalt Blocks, the speed will return to normal. With no other boosts, running on asphalt has a max speed of 53 mph, with about 3 seconds of acceleration, while the normal maximum running speed is 15 mph or 18 mph PC version, Console version, Mobile version, and tModLoader version.

=== Pew-matic Horn ===
Description: The Pew-matic Horn is a gun dropped by the Deerclops with a 25*1/4 (25%) chance. Bullets fired by this weapon quickly lose their horizontal speed once shot and are heavily affected by gravity. The type of bullet used does not change the projectiles fired by this weapon. Instead, the Pew-matic Horn will fire many random items. The damage dealt changes depending on the visual of the projectile being fired. Its best modifier is Unreal.


=== Aaron's set ===
Description: Aaron's set are vanity developer items that can be obtained rarely (5% chance) from Treasure Bags in Expert Mode. They are acquired simultaneously. They are the set made for AaronC, an artist who formerly developed graphics for Terraria. Equipping the full set produces a glow effect similar to Spooky armor and grants an after-image movement effect similar to Ninja armor.

Wasps deal no knockback. Its best modifier is Demonic or Deadly for damage output, or Mystic for mana conservation because it cannot get modifiers that affect knockback.


=== Stynger ===
Description: The Stynger is a Hardmode, post-Golem ranged weapon which has a 14.29*1/7 (14.29%) / 12.5*1/8 (12.5%) chance to be dropped by Golem. It auto-fires Stynger Bolts, which are initially dropped by Golem along with the weapon, and can also later be purchased from the Witch Doctor or Arms Dealer when the Stynger is in the player's inventory. The Stynger Bolts explode on impact, dealing damage to anything in the explosion radius. Arching shrapnel is thrown from the explosion, each causing additional smaller explosions that inflict the same base damage. The initial bolt does double damage on direct hits to a single target. This does not apply to the fragments. Its best modifier is Unreal.


=== Celebration Mk2 ===
Description: The Celebration Mk2 is a Hardmode, post-Moon Lord launcher that is an upgraded version of the Celebration. Upon use, it fires one of 7 different special rocket types, regardless of the type of ammunition used.

Description: Pedguin's set is a vanity set. Corrupt and Vicious Penguins have a 2*1/50 (2%) chance to drop the whole set.


=== Bait ===
Description: Bait is a group of items that is mandatory for fishing. When a fishing pole is cast, at least one bait item must be in the player's inventory; otherwise, nothing can be caught. Fishing poles will cast their lines with no baits, but there will be no "bites" and no catches. The bait item is only consumed once the player reels in the line with a catch on the hook. It is not consumed upon the player casting the line or the line being reeled in with no catch. Even when the player does reel in a fish, there is only a chance that the bait will be consumed. There are several items that can serve as bait, and they must be obtained in different ways depending on the type. Bait power influences the quality of the catch (see Fishing for details and other factors), as well as the chances that the bait item will be consumed upon successfully reeling in a catch: Higher bait powers mean lower chance that the bait item will be consumed. The formula used to determine the chance if the bait will be consumed is as follows:[1] chance to consume = 1 1 + bait power / 6 {\displaystyle \text{chance to consume} = \frac{1}{1 + \text{bait power} / 6}} , where bait power {\displaystyle \text{bait power}} is the item's listed bait power multiplied by 100 (e.g. 15 for Apprentice Bait). The Tackle Box, Angler Tackle Bag, and Lavaproof Tackle Bag have a beneficial effect on bait consumption chance. With any of these equipped (they do not stack), the formula is as follows: chance to consume = 1 2 + bait power / 6 {\displaystyle \text{chance to consume} = \frac{1}{2 + \text{bait power} / 6}} The following table lists exemplary chances for some bait items: It can be seen that the effects of the Tackle Box and its upgrades are less useful for items high in bait power. As of 1.4.4 Gold Worms have an additional hidden reduced chance to be consumed, 1/20 (5%), this does not change the bait power so it does not give higher quality fishing catches compared to other gold baits


=== Star ===
Description: Stars (or Soul Cakes during Halloween and Sugar Plums during Christmas) are common power-ups which can be dropped by any enemy with a chance of 54.17*13/24 (54.17%), as long as the player is below maximum mana. They are not inventory items, but are instead instantly consumed and restore 100 mana. Enemies will only drop Stars if the closest player is not at maximum mana. It is also possible to spawn Stars (and their seasonal counterparts) with a Star Statue. They can be collected within range of 2 blocks, which can be increased with Celestial Magnet and its upgrades. Template:Eil/options Template:Eil/options


=== Blowpipe ===
Description: The Blowpipe is a gun that auto-fires Seeds and Darts as ammunition.

Flowers growing in Clay Pots and Planter Boxes can also yield Seeds. Both wild and cultivated flowers typically drop 4 Seeds at a time; tall grass typically drops 1–2 Seeds. The Blowpipe can be found randomly in Wooden Chests near the Surface or in the Underground layer. Its best modifier is Unreal.

=== Katana ===
Description: The Katana is a melee weapon that is purchased from the Traveling Merchant for 10 / 4 / 250. Considering it can be acquired very early into the game, the Katana can be quite useful as it has very good stats for an early game sword. The Katana has a base 19% critical strike chance, as opposed to the usual 4%, and has autoswing, which makes it extremely useful. Its best modifier is Legendary.


=== Silver Bow ===
Description: The Silver Bow is a strong, mid-tier bow crafted solely using Silver Bars. Its sole purpose is to fire arrows from a distance to deal damage to enemies. Its best modifier is Demonic, as it does not have any knockback and thus cannot get modifiers that affect it. It can also get the Deadly modifier, which, while the Demonic modifier may provide the greatest damage per hit, grants a higher increase to the overall DPS.

=== Thrown Powder ===
Description: Thrown Powders are items that can be used to convert blocks and walls between their Crimson, Corrupt, or Hallowed forms. When thrown, they release as a cloud spread with a very short range, comparable to that of a Broadsword, and produce a fair amount of light. Thrown Powder comes in three variants: Purification Powder is able to revert any Corrupted or Crimson Blocks, but not walls, back into their pure form, such as reverting Ebonstone into Stone or Crimsand into Sand. It is purchased from the Dryad for 75each, while Blood Moon is not active. Throwing purification powder at a Mystic Frog transforms it into the Mystic Slime, one of the Town slimes In Hardmode, one can use Purification Powder on a Tortured Soul in order to obtain the Tax Collector NPC. Unlike Holy Water and Blue Solution, Purification Powder cannot spread or purify the Hallow. Vile Powder is able to convert blocks and walls, including the Crimson and the Hallowed ones, into their Corrupted form / pure form, such as converting Pearlstone into Ebonstone / Stone. If thrown at a Bunny, Penguin, or Goldfish, it will turn into its Corrupted variants: Corrupt Bunny, Corrupt Penguin, and Corrupt Goldfish, respectively. It can be crafted from Vile Mushrooms or can be purchased from the Dryad for 1 each, during a Blood Moon in a Corrupt world. Vile Powder can be used to spread the Corruption onto convertible tiles. Unlike Unholy Water and Purple Solution, Vile Powder cannot spread the Corruption. Vicious Powder is functionally identical to its counterpart, Vile Powder, to where it can convert blocks and walls, including the Corrupted and the Hallowed ones, into their Crimson form / pure form. If thrown at a Bunny, Penguin, or Goldfish, it will turn into its Crimson variants: Vicious Bunny, Vicious Penguin, and Vicious Goldfish, respectively. It can be crafted from Vicious Mushrooms or can be purchased from the Dryad for 1 each, during a Blood Moon in a Crimson world. Vicious Powder can be used to spread the Crimson onto convertible tiles. Unlike Blood Water and Red Solution, Vicious Powder cannot spread the Crimson.

=== Ancient Hallowed armor ===
Description: Ancient Hallowed armor is a Hardmode armor set. It has ranged, melee, summoner, and magic set versions, depending on the equipped headpiece. Crafting a full set with one headpiece requires 54 Hallowed Bars (dropped by the mechanical bosses), or 90 Hallowed Bars for the full set including all four headpieces. Wearing a full set gives off a faint pulsing aura around the player and displays an after-image effect while in motion. To acquire the necessary Hallowed Bars for a full set with one helmet, a player will need to kill a mechanical boss 2-4 times, and 3-4 times for all four helmets. It currently shares identical stats with Hallowed armor, but differs in appearance. Furthermore, Ancient Hallowed and Hallowed armor pieces can be mixed and matched while still providing their set bonus.

The set also becomes transparent, possibly meaning the player becomes a ghost, however the set parts are still separated.


=== Mythril Drill ===
Description: The Mythril Drill is a Hardmode drill, and is the drill alternative to the Mythril Pickaxe. Appearances and sounds aside, the two tools are nearly functionally identical. The drill, however is half a second faster. But, unlike pickaxes, most drills cannot be reforged with size, speed, or knockback modifiers. It can mine any block except Chlorophyte Ore and Lihzahrd Bricks. Its best modifier is Demonic, as it does not have any knockback and is a drill, and therefore cannot get modifiers that affect knockback or speed.

=== Golden Shower ===
Description: The Golden Shower is a Hardmode magic weapon that fires an arching piercing golden stream, similar to the Aqua Scepter. The Golden Shower fires three times per click, each stream can pierce up to eight enemies, and the player can change the direction of aim between these sprays. Enemies hit will be inflicted with the Ichor debuff, which lowers their defense by 15 / 20 and causes them to glow gold, even in complete darkness. However, this cannot be used to explore the map, as the enemy coated in ichor does not actually emit light. Crafting the Golden Shower requires ingredients found only in worlds containing Crimson. In worlds originally generated with Corruption, Crimson Seeds can be purchased from the Dryad while in a Graveyard in a Hardmode world in order to create the Underground Crimson biome in which Ichor can be obtained. On PC version, Console version, Mobile version, and tModLoader version, it has a 33.33*1/3 (33.33%) chance to be dropped by the Jungle Mimic in a world with the seed celebrationmk10. Its best modifier is Mythical. However, an alternative modifier is Mystic or Masterful, for those who just want to benefit from the Ichor debuff this weapon applies.

=== Crystal Shard ===
Description: Crystal Shards are a common Hardmode () crafting material found in the Underground Hallow, where they naturally grow on any side of Pearlstone Blocks and Pink Ice Blocks. Due to their constant regrowth, they can be farmed. Crystal Shards emit a small glow, similar to Demonite Ore and Crimtane Ore. They do not spread the Hallow. Crystal Shards furthermore have a 50*1/2 (50%) chance to be obtained from Divine Crates, in stacks of 4–10. On the Windows Phone version and Nintendo 3DS version, they are always dropped by Arch Demons in stacks of 3–4 and are thus available pre-Hardmode. Crystal Shards are also placeable in nearly any position (on walls, floors, and ceilings), though they are often not luminous enough to replace other light sources, and placement has no other functional effect. Although natural Crystal Shards can only grow on Pearlstone and Pink Ice, once harvested, they can be placed anywhere. Crafting all items, including only one color of Phasesaber (excluding consumables), requires a total of 115 Crystal Shards. Add 250 for all the other Phasesaber colors.

=== Spectre armor ===
Description: Spectre armor is a Hardmode, post-Plantera armor set that offers magic weapon boosts. The set consists of the Spectre Robe and Spectre Pants, with either the Spectre Hood or Spectre Mask headpiece. Wearing a full set causes small white orbs to manifest whenever the player hits an enemy with a magic weapon. The effect of these orbs depends on the headpiece option chosen: The Spectre Mask causes the orbs to act as homing projectiles, while the Spectre Hood causes the orbs to travel to a player, healing them. Crafting a full set with one headpiece requires 54 Spectre Bars (27 Ectoplasm and 270 / 324 Chlorophyte Ore). The full set with both headpieces requires 66 Spectre Bars (33 Ectoplasm and 330 / 396 Chlorophyte Ore). Crafting a full set with one headpiece requires 54 Chlorophyte Bars (325 Chlorophyte Ore) and 54 Ectoplasm. The full set with both headpieces requires 66 Chlorophyte Bars (396 Chlorophyte Ore) and 66 Ectoplasm. Spectre Mask set bonus: Homing orb projectiles spawn when dealing magic damage to an enemy, which attack nearby enemies, or the same enemy. The orbs deal 100% / 50% of the damage dealt by the magic weapon fired, before it is doubled by a critical hit (if a critical hit deals 200 damage, the orb will have 100 / 50 base damage). Spectre Hood set bonus: Life-stealing orbs spawn when dealing magic damage to an enemy, which fly to the player and restore health by 20% / 8% of damage done (e.g. dealing 50 magic damage heals 10 / 4 health). In multiplayer, the player with the lowest health on the team is healed instead. Equipping full set with the Spectre Hood / the Spectre Hood incurs a 40% magic damage decrease.

=== Sleepy Octopod ===
Description: The Sleepy Octopod is a Hardmode melee weapon dropped by the Ogre mini-boss during the Old One's Army event. After swinging the Sleepy Octopod for about 1 second, green particles appear at the tip of the weapon, signifying that it is ready to deliver its secondary attack: If the head hits a block at the end of the swing, it causes a 3 by 12-tile explosion. Between explosions, it acts as a swung melee weapon, dealing regular damage on contact with enemies. The explosion deals triple damage and will damage enemies through blocks. Because of the distance that the head is at when the swing finishes, the explosion will not hit enemies closer than two blocks from the player, though the weapon itself will hit these enemies, dealing regular damage. Its best modifier is Godly or Demonic. Both modifiers increase the average damage output by the same amount.


=== Mythril armor ===
Description: Mythril armor is an armor which requires Mythril Bars and must be crafted at a Mythril Anvil. Like all Hardmode ore armors, Mythril armor has three different headgear/helmet options, allowing players to focus on magical, melee or ranged combat, and each changing the set bonus. The alternative to Mythril Armor is Orichalcum Armor. Crafting a one-helmet set requires 45 Mythril Bars, or 180 Mythril Ore. Crafting all five pieces requires 65 Mythril Bars, or 260 Mythril Ore.

=== Luminite Drills ===
Description: The Luminite Drills are four tools, all of which have the same stats. The four types are the Vortex Drill, Nebula Drill, Solar Flare Drill, and the Stardust Drill, each themed after a different Celestial Pillar. On Old Chinese and tModLoader Legacy, their pickaxe counterparts must be crafted instead. Unlike all other drills, Luminite Drills can be reforged with size and speed modifiers, but this is made irrelevant by the fact that they cannot benefit from them, thus, a drill with Deadly or Light mines just as fast as one with no modifier. With current methods, it is impossible to hack these items into a character's inventory using external editors, as they will disappear from that character's inventory as soon as they load into a world. Their best modifier is Demonic, as they do not have any knockback and thus cannot get modifiers that affect it, and furthermore cannot get modifiers that affect their speed, either.

Presents always appear as blue in the player's inventory. Once placed, the present will appear as a random color. On the Nintendo 3DS version, the old Blue, Green, and Yellow Presents still exist but they cannot be placed. Initially, Presents dropped from Present Mimics could be placed, although they disappeared after placement. They no longer drop, but have not yet been removed from 3DS. For more information, see Present (furniture). Presents always only drop one item, with the exception of the Red Ryder, which drops with Musket Balls, and the three vanity sets, which each include all three items of the set.[1] Template:Eil/options Template:Eil/options

=== Life Booster ===
Description: A Life Booster is one of the three power-ups occasionally dropped when striking an enemy while wearing a full set of Nebula armor. When picked up, it grants the Life Nebula buff which immediately increases the player's health regeneration rate by 3/5 health per second for 8 seconds. When a Life Booster is picked up while the Life Nebula buff is already in effect, it stacks with the previous Life Nebula, for up to 3 stacked boosts. Every 8 seconds, one stacked Life Booster expires, and the Life Nebula buff decreases by one level. Life Boosters, like all Nebula boosters, float in the air and have a pickup range of approximately five tiles. They cannot legitimately appear in a player's inventory.

Each piece is interchangeable with the equivalent Shadow armor piece, while still granting the same set bonus. When the full set is equipped, the player will emit purple bubbles, and create a semi-transparent after-image effect behind themselves when moving. This effect appears to be clones of the player. These clones do not appear to have bodies inside of the armor, as there is no face prevalent. Each piece has a 0.19*1/525 (0.19%) chance of being dropped by an Eater of Souls. Each piece can also be obtained by transmutating its non-ancient counterpart in Shimmer.

=== Star Hairpin ===
Description: The Star Hairpin is a vanity item that can be purchased from the Traveling Merchant for 2. It is worn in the helmet slot.


=== Crystal Vile Shard ===
Description: The Crystal Vile Shard is a Hardmode magic weapon that is an upgraded version of the Vilethorn and a precursor to the Nettle Burst. It fires a larger, colorful, crystalline version of the Vilethorn's spear projectile, piercing through blocks and enemies. It has a 25% chance to be dropped by Hallowed Mimics. Like the Nettle Burst, the Crystal Vile Shard ignores up to 10 of the target's defense. Its best modifier is Mythical.


=== Red's set ===
Description: Red's set are vanity developer items that can be obtained rarely (5% chance) from Treasure Bags in Expert Mode.(except for Queen Slime's) It is the vanity set made for Redigit, lead developer of Terraria. Redigit's equipment also includes these non-vanity items, which will drop in addition to his clothing set:


=== Frost Daggerfish ===
Description: The Frost Daggerfish is a consumable ranged weapon that can pierce up to two enemies (hitting 3). Up to 100 can be fished from lakes in Snow biomes at a time. When thrown, the Frost Daggerfish acts similarly to Shurikens or Throwing Knives, flying in an arc and then spinning to the ground. The Angler uses Frost Daggerfish to defend himself against nearby enemies.


=== Smooth Granite Block ===
Description: Smooth Granite Blocks are blocks with a dark blue appearance. The block can be found as walls in underground houses in Granite Caves. They can be used to craft the Granite furniture set.

=== Red Riding armor ===
Description: The Red Riding armor is a ranger-oriented armor set purchased from the Tavernkeep for 1500000*150 in total, after Golem has been defeated. The set consists of the Red Riding Hood, Red Riding Dress and Red Riding Leggings. Wearing the full set will cause Explosive Traps to attack much faster (from every 1.83 seconds to every 0.67 seconds) and to have a 1/2 chance to inflict 4-9 seconds of the Oiled debuff, making enemies take increased damage from On Fire!, Cursed Inferno, Frostburn and Shadowflame. A full set of Red Riding armor will provide the following stats: The Red Riding armor set is a direct upgrade of the Huntress armor set.


=== Soul of Flight ===
Description: The Soul of Flight is a Hardmode crafting material used to craft several different types of wings and the Soul of Flight in a Bottle. Souls of Flight are dropped by Wyverns and Arch Wyverns and are the most common soul aside from the Souls of Light and Night. Souls of Flight are dropped at the position of the Wyvern's head upon death, and like all other souls, float in midair at the drop point, rather than falling to the ground. This can make Souls of Flight more difficult to spot, e.g. if the Wyvern's head was off-screen or within blocks at the time of death. Crafting all Wings that require Souls of Flight requires 300 / 315 / 295 Souls of Flight, meaning the player must defeat 30-60 or 15-30 Wyverns / 32-63 Wyverns or 15-60 Arch Wyverns .

=== Goodie Bag ===
Description: The Goodie Bag is a grab bag-type item available during the Halloween seasonal event. Each contains one random reward from the list below. Goodie Bags are opened by pressing ⚷ Interact from within the player's inventory, similar to all other grab bags. They can be opened anytime, even outside the Halloween season. Goodie Bags are dropped by any enemy except statue-spawned enemies and Meteor Heads with a 1.25*1/80 (1.25%) chance, during Halloween only.


=== Gold armor ===
Description: Gold armor is the fourth armor set in the game. It takes a total of 75 / 90 Gold Bars to craft a full suit, or 300 / 360 Gold Ores. It consists of a Gold Helmet, Gold Chainmail and Gold Greaves. The Ancient Gold Helmet is a rare drop from Skeletons in the Underground, and is functionally identical to the Gold Helmet. The two helmets are interchangeable, with no bonus loss. A full set grants a basic 13 defense plus a set bonus of 3 defense, which equals a total of 16 defense.

=== Fishing ===
Description: Fishing is accomplished by using a Fishing Pole at a body of liquid (water, honey, or lava) while having bait in the player's inventory. While near the body of liquid, pressing the ⚒ Use / Attack button at a point over the liquid will cast a line into the liquid. Pressing the button again when the bobber moves up and down will reel in the line and often an item will come up with the line. The Angler NPC provides daily fishing quests and rewards their completion with an assortment of equipment, coins, potions, and vanity items. Fishing provides resources: Crafting materials for potions and food, a variety of very useful items such as mobility improvements like a Frog Leg or Balloon Pufferfish, and even a pet Zephyr Fish. Through crates, fishing also provides an alternative source for ores, coins, many chest items (Sailfish Boots can replace Hermes or Flurry Boots), and some specialties such as the powerful Falcon Blade. While fishing is not strictly necessary for game progression, some of the Angler's quest rewards (the Fish Finder components) are required to complete the Shellphone. Fishing is also required to fight the boss Duke Fishron. To summon the boss, a Truffle Worm must be used as fishing bait in an Ocean biome. For pre-Hardmode players, fishing can be a good way of getting money and equipment; by mid-Hardmode, it is less competitive with other money-making options, enemy drops, and advancing equipment. 75 connected tiles of liquid are required (1,001 for Oceans, 50 for honey) in order for fishing to work, and 300 or more tiles to be optimal (1,001 for Oceans, 200 for honey). The width of the top row of continuous liquid tiles (the row where the fishing bobber sits) determines the calculated pond width, and then the depth directly below those is counted. If the pond becomes wider at lower depths, that additional width is not counted. The player may successfully fish in a 1-tile-wide pond, as long as it's 75 tiles deep. The minimal required depth is 2 tiles.Verify Nothing will ever bite while the bobber is floating over a pond that's 1 tile deep and 300 tiles wide. The distance of the bobber to the shoreline does not matter. No fish will bite if the bobber can't fully come up and float on water. This can happen if a solid block is right above water level and is blocking the bobber. The bobber will also move horizontally while something is on the hook. If it ends up in a position where it can't float on top of water, nothing will be able to bite after. It is not possible to fish when the player is submerged in liquid, even partially, and even within a completely disconnected body of water. Fishing can, however, be done while moving, flying, while grappled to blocks, sitting on a chair, while floating on water with the Slime Mount, while mounted on a minecart, or while standing on top of the water, e.g. using Water Walking Boots. Fishing can be done in Lava, but will only work with the Hotline Fishing Hook, a Lavaproof Tackle Bag, a Lavaproof Fishing Hook, or by using a Magma Snail, Lavafly, or Hell Butterfly (which can be caught using a Lavaproof Bug Net or Golden Bug Net). It can take much longer to get a bite in lava, but the chances increase with at least two of these sources; see the Catch Frequency section below for details. Catching a quest fish for the Angler NPC requires fishing in the proper biome, and height for the day's current quest, which can be determined by talking to the Angler. Quest fish cannot be caught if the player already has that particular quest fish in their inventory, or if the quest fish was already turned in that day. However, if the player puts the Quest fish in a safe/bank then they may catch another Quest Fish. The player can then transfer the Quest Fish to a chest if they wish. The Angler gives out special rewards when a proper quest fish is turned in. The player does not need to speak with him beforehand, nor have even encountered him, but the chances of finding the correct area to fish for a quest are much lower without speaking to him first. Each day, the angler will change his quest at 4:30AM. Given the prerequisites for fishing are fulfilled, some factors influence the quality/rarity of the caught item. There is a variety of relevant equipment: All the factors are combined into a total Fishing Power that determines the chances of higher-quality catches. Fishing Power is calculated by starting with adding these three basic factors: After the above three kinds of factors are added, bonuses (or penalties) are applied, as follows: Amounts in the tables below that influence fishing power are marked green or red. Because some of the bonus factors are percentages, the fishing power amounts given by any of the three basic factors can seem to vary depending on, e.g., time of day or weather. (For example, when fishing during rain, the Angler Earring can appear to provide more than just +10 Fishing Power.) There are two factors which affect Fishing Power that are hidden from the player (e.g. they never affect the numbers displayed in the UI by the Fisherman's Pocket Guide or related accessories): Fishing Poles are used with bait for fishing. Some are craftable, while others are either sold by NPCs, found in Chests, or are awarded by the Angler. If the player has multiple bait items in their inventory, they are used in order from the top down, then left to right. Bait can be placed in ammo slots, and bait placed there will be used first / used last . To have the best results from fishing in lava, lavaproof bait should be placed before other bait. These items can be caught at any time. Most can serve as crafting material for Food (Cooked Fish) and other Potions. Some can also craft other item types. Jellyfish can be used as bait. Most can be sold to NPCs. Note that the height requirements are mostly split between "Surface and above," versus "Underground and below." Of these items, only three items cannot be caught in either the Surface or Underground layers: The Damselfish (Sky only) and the Blue or Green Jellyfish (Cavern or Underworld only). Quest fish are items that can be caught only when their particular quest is active and serve no purpose other than acquiring quest rewards. The player can determine the day's quest by speaking to the Angler NPC. There are 41 distinctive variants of quest fish. These items can be used directly without further crafting. Most are Tools or Weapons, many of which are best-in-class for large parts of the game. There are also a couple of Accessories offering jump boosts, an improvement on Healing Potions, a Pet, and in Hardmode, a mount summon. The Angler's rewards fill out the set somewhat, with an early mount, a top-tier (Pre-Hardmode) Hook, and several items to help with fishing. Crates are stackable grab-bag type items that each contain random loot, including potions, bait, useful items, coins, metal bars, and even ores. They can be right-clicked from within the player's inventory, which will unload their contents. Rarer Crate types contain more valuable loot. The biome crates can provide items otherwise found only in the matching biome chests, including Crimson Hearts/Shadow Orbs and the items found in Dungeon chests. (Not all biomes or special chests have matching crates.) Crates are one of the major sources of "alternate" metals and ores. These items have no coin value, they can however be put through an extractinator to receive either fishing worms/apprentice fishing bait. They can each be stacked up to 99 in a single inventory slot. The player will only "catch" these if a lake is too small or if their Fishing Power is too low. When a lake is at least 300 tiles (200 for honey) in size or the player's total fishing power is at least 50, the player will no longer catch junk. Additionally, the player has a 1/8 (12.5%) chance of catching a Joja Cola instead of a junk item when fishing. Note that the Seaweed junk item should not be confused with the Seaweed pet summon item, which is found in Jungle Crates and Bramble Crates fished up in the jungle, as well as Jungle shrines and Living Rich Mahogany Trees. During a Blood Moon event, fishing in water can cause several Blood Moon-themed enemies to spawn. These enemies are: Upon retracting the line during a Blood Moon, there is a 16.67*1/6 (16.67%) chance (33.33*1/3 (33.33%) with the Chum Caster) that one of these enemies will spawn. Note that fishing power has no effect on this mechanic, nor does the use of Chum Buckets. If the player is using a Sonar Potion, the spawn will be shown with the enemy's name in red, giving players a second or two to prepare for the oncoming attack. In pre-Hardmode, the only enemies that can appear are the Zombie Merman and the Wandering Eye Fish, with an equal chance of each. In Hardmode, the Dreadnautilus has a 10*1/10 (10%) chance of appearing, and the other four enemies have equal remaining chances of appearing (22.5*9/40 (22.5%)). Each of these enemies has a chance to drop Chum Buckets used to further increase fishing power. They also can drop several special items: When fishing, there is a hidden catch counter which tracks the player's progress toward making a catch. The counter normally starts at 0 and increases over time. When it exceeds 660, there is a ((75 + fishing power) / 2) % chance that a fish will bite, capping out at 125 fishing power. The counter then resets to 0, regardless of whether or not there was a bite. When fishing in lava with at least two lava-proof bait, a Hotline Fishing Hook or one of the two lava-proof accessories (Lavaproof Fishing Hook or Lavaproof Tackle Bag), the counter resets to 240 instead (if there was no bite). Using all three has the same effect as using only two[1]. The catch counter increases every tick (there are 60 ticks per second) according to these factors: Therefore, a formula for the average catch rate would look like this: or simply: For example, with a fishing power of 125, the player can expect to catch a fish around once every 1.5 seconds: A player can be eligible for catching fish from multiple biomes at once; however, certain biomes take priority over others. The priority order is: The height requirement (Sky/Surface/Underground/Cavern) is set by the height of the surface of the water, not by the position of the player. This can be taken advantage of by creating two adjacent pools of water on different layers. This allows the player to fish in either while standing at the same spot. There are five height zones for fishing (see Layers): There are 6 different catch quality slots for catches, each with its own associated probability: The denominators are rounded down. A fishing power of 85, for example, would have a 1.92*1/52 (1.92%) chance of an Extremely Rare catch. When a new fish is generated, each different catch quality is checked for success, separately from one another. For example, the Uncommon, Rare, and Very Rare rolls might all succeed, while the Common and Extremely Rare rolls fail. Then, depending on which roll(s) succeed as well as factors such as height and biome, the game will generate a fish. With some exceptions, the highest catch quality roll that succeeded will take priority over lower catch quality slots in determining which fish a player receives. However, not every catch quality slot will contain a fish that can be caught; in that case, the game will move on to checking lower catch qualities. Success at the higher catch quality roll will not carry down to lower quality slots. For example, if the Rare roll succeeded but there is no Rare fish available to be caught, the game will move on to checking whether or not the Uncommon roll succeeded; if the Uncommon roll failed, it will move on to checking Common. Each biome has a list of available biome-specific fish that can be caught there, based on the catch quality rolls and other factors. If no biome-specific fish is generated, the game will move on to checking subsequent, lower priority biomes. Many of the fish available in catch quality slots vary based on randomness, so succeeding at a catch quality roll in a specific biome does not guarantee that the player will get a specific fish of that quality or any fish of that quality at all. If no fish is selected for the slot, the game will proceed to check more common slots instead and move on to subsequent biomes if and only if none of those slots contain fish either. When fishing in the water, a successful Extremely Rare roll will always check for a special catch first (Frog Leg, Balloon Pufferfish, and Zephyr Fish, in that order). If none of these checks succeed, the game will then check for biome-specific fish. All quest fish occupy the Uncommon slot, except the Mirage Fish and Pixiefish, which are Rare. All quest fish are Uncommon. There are only four Plentiful fish: Bass, Trout, Flounder, and Rock Lobster. If all other checks fail and the player is fishing in the water, they will catch one of these by default: Trout if fishing in the Ocean, Flounder or Rock Lobster if fishing in the Desert or Oasis on PC version, Console version, Mobile version, and tModLoader version (with Rock Lobster being half as common as Flounder), and Bass otherwise. There is a separate roll to determine if a Crate is caught, defaulting to 10% (or 20% with a Crate Potion active). An Extremely Rare or Very Rare catch will generate a Golden Crate, a Rare catch will generate a biome-specific crate (if applicable, otherwise it will generate an Iron Crate), an Uncommon catch will generate an Iron Crate, and a Wooden Crate otherwise. In Hardmode, the crate will be the Hardmode-equivalent crate. Fishing in honey will never generate a crate. Fishing in lava can generate Obsidian Crates in pre-hardmode, and Hellstone Crates in hardmode. Stackable fish (i.e., Bomb Fish and Frost Daggerfish) generate in stacks that vary based on the player's fishing power. These can vary significantly, with higher fishing power levels generating higher minimum stack sizes as well as significantly higher maximum stack sizes. The Angler gives six different accessories as rewards, but with the Tinkerer's Workshop, those can be combined into one functional and one informational accessory: A quest fish cannot be fished or picked up when the player already has one in inventory, but it is easy enough to stash the fish in a Chest, Piggy Bank, or even the trash slot (though you can easily lose the fish this way) and collect multiples. Fishing in long stretches can be tedious and is also not very efficient. It is better to fish in smaller stretches and cherry-pick the times (moon, weather, luck) when the player has bonuses: Any time 3AM or 3PM approaches, the player should check conditions: With overcast/rain, a full moon, or a lucky event (ladybug swarm or Lantern Night), if the other two factors are at least neutral, then it is worth trying for a fishing session. Even if the player isn't primarily fishing for crates, the 3-minute duration of a Crate Potion makes a good benchmark. Even one potion will usually give more than enough time to collect several crates and several copies of a quest fish if one is available. Starting a fishing session between 3:00-4:30 AM or 4:30-6:00 PM will allow the Crate potion's duration to cover one of the "prime times" noted above while avoiding the following "dead time." If conditions are still good when the first potion runs out, a second potion may be worthwhile even if it runs into dead time, and it may even be worth finishing out the Sonar Potion's duration. A portable storage item allows a quick-change into and out of fishing gear, including swapping armor for the Fishing set. Lava fishing can begin pre-Hardmode but can get easier in Hardmode. The player needs at least one out of three factors (bait, pole, accessory), and having two of them will drastically speed up catches: The maximum possible Fishing Power is 346 / 283 / 264 . Equipment bonuses add to 170: The weather, Moon phase and Time of day bonuses multiply that: The Chum Bucket adds further bonuses: Other bonuses: Luck has the potential to further increase Fishing Power: With +1.4 luck, 346 Fishing Power can randomly become up to 486 Fishing Power for any given cast. Once a player has their Golden Bug Net, Golden Fishing Rod, Fish Finder, and an Angler Tackle Bag (or even two Tackle Bags, and/or a spare Angler Earring), the Angler can give them little else until Hardmode. Fishing without the Angler can still be profitable, notably by collecting crates and other special catches. Angler reward chances generally rise over time, but after the 150th Angler quest, most of the reward chances go back to their initial odds and stay there. Once the player has gotten the important pre-Hardmode rewards, they should leave off Angler quests until Hardmode, and hopefully avoid hitting the deadline before getting the Hardmode rewards. It is also helpful to stockpile crates before Hardmode, which can be opened in Hardmode for an early source of Hardmode ores and bars. After Hardmode, there are only a couple more weapons and a mount to catch (Toxikarp or Bladetongue, Crystal Serpent, Scaly Truffle), and a few more useful Angler rewards: The Bottomless Water Bucket and Super Absorbant Sponge for water handling, and the Hotline Fishing Hook (a misnamed pole) for fishing in lava. Once a player has all that, they're done with the Angler Quests. Fishing can still provide potion resupply, bars (especially the alternates), and coins (the Scaly Truffle is a good target), but no new items after this point.

=== Switch ===
Description: The Switch is an activation mechanism purchased from the Mechanic for 20. It can also be found in the Dungeon connected to Chain Lanterns, where it can be harvested with a Pickaxe or Drill. The Switch can be placed on top or on the sides of blocks, or on the sides of Wooden Beams or trees. Switches can also be placed on background walls. It is activated by right-clicking on it. Despite its name, the Switch does not need to act as an on/off mechanism. When wired to Dart Traps, for example, right-clicking the Switch will always cause the Trap to shoot, the same as a Pressure Plate would, no matter which position the switch happens to be in.


=== Magic Conch ===
Description: The Magic Conch is a item that teleports the player to the Ocean farthest from the player. Like the Magic Mirror, it can be used limitlessly. It can be found randomly in Sandstone Chests, Oasis Crates, and Mirage Crates.

=== Tin Ore ===
Description: Tin Ore is an early game ore, which spawns on the surface as well as in the Underground and Cavern biomes. It is the second weakest and most easily obtained tier of ore in the game. Its primary use is to make Tin Bars, which can be used to create the tin tier of equipment. The equivalent of Tin Ore is Copper Ore, which will sometimes replace tin on a world. Tin Ore has a small chance to appear as a bonus drop from Slimes.

=== Tombstones ===
Description: A Tombstone drops when a player dies. It can then be retrieved and used much like a sign or as a form of decoration. By default, they contain the death message generated based on how the player died. Additionally, Tombstones created in 1.4 () and later show the real life date the player died. Upon death, a Tombstone will bounce around until it lands on a 2×2 empty space, at which point it will place itself. Two Tombstones cannot land on each other, nor can they be retrieved if they fail to place themselves (e.g., due to lack of suitable space). If a tombstone can not find a place to land, it will eventually despawn. Variants are chosen randomly upon death. Golden Tombstones drop when the player had more than 10 gold in their inventory. In 1.4.0.1 1.4, having 4-8 Tombstones placed in close proximity will gradually darken and desaturate the environment. Five or more Tombstones placed in close proximity will generate a Graveyard mini-biome. Breaking a Tombstone may spawn a Ghost offscreen. The Strange Looking Tombstone is a Windows Phone and 3DS-exclusive Tombstone variant dropped when the Worm Pet is active at death. Its tooltip is "A Tombstone that kinda looks like a worm, right?". It can be re-placed after being mined (confirm, Suspicious Looking Apple page has different information). In hardcore, Tombstones cannot be easily obtained because death is permanent. In 1.4.0.1, NPCs in worlds with hardcore characters will now drop Tombstones when they are killed. This makes it possible to build Graveyards without the need for a non-hardcore character. Variants are still chosen randomly, all NPCs drop a normal tombstone except Merchant and Tax Collector who drop a golden variant. Because Tombstones create Graveyards, and mark a place where a player had died, they are highlighted by Dangersense Potions.


=== Frostburn Arrow ===
Description: Frostburn Arrows are a type of ammunition which have a chance to inflict the Frostburn debuff upon hitting an enemy. Similar to Flaming Arrows, Frostburn Arrows have a 33.33*1/3 (33.33%) chance to drop as an item upon impact, allowing them to be recovered. However, only 1/3 of those that do drop as an item will remain Frostburn Arrows; the rest will revert to Wooden Arrows. This means that on average one out of nine fired Frostburn arrows may be recovered.

=== Balloon Pufferfish ===
Description: The Balloon Pufferfish is an accessory that increases the player's jump height by 33% and jump speed by 30%, increasing the height that the player can jump from 6 blocks (12 feet) to ~10½ blocks (21 feet), effectively a ~75% boost; however, it oddly reduces jump height when underwater, from 8 blocks (16 feet) to 7 blocks (14 feet), meaning it grants the same jump height bonus and downside as the Shiny Red Balloon. It can be obtained via fishing in any biome.

=== Pearls ===
Description: Pearls are crafting materials obtained from opening Oysters, and are used to craft Luck Potions. The Pink Pearl can be transmuted into the Galaxy Pearl by being thrown into Shimmer. Each of the three pearls have different rarities, with the rarer ones being crafted into stronger potions. The player can only receive one pearl from each Oyster, with a 20*1/5 (20%) chance in total.

=== Planter Boxes ===
Description: Planter Boxes are special gardening objects purchased from the Dryad for 1 each. Herbs can be planted in them just like Clay Pots: Herbs growing in planter boxes are harvested only by using a pickaxe or Staff of Regrowth/Axe of Regrowth on them. Nearby swinging tools will not accidentally break plants in a Planter Box. Unlike Clay Pots, planter boxes are placed and act like platforms: They do not require support beneath them and they can be walked on, but pressing ▼ Down will let a player fall through them. If no herbs are planted in the planter boxes they will begin to grow flowers. These flowers have a small chance to drop a worm or grasshopper when broken. Although the various planter boxes have different seed names and appearances, the differences are purely cosmetic: Any herb seeds can grow in any planter box. Depending on the evil biome of the world, the Dryad will sell a Deathweed Planter Box showing either Corrupt grass or Crimson grass.

Description: The Revolver is a gun purchased from the Traveling Merchant for 10 after a Shadow Orb or Crimson Heart has been smashed. Statistically, it is an upgrade to The Undertaker. It can also be considered an upgrade to the Red Ryder, due to its faster use time. However, the Red Ryder has autoswing while the Revolver does not. In the PC version, Console version, Mobile version, Old Chinese version, tModLoader version, and tModLoader 1.3-Legacy version, the Traveling Merchant also uses it to defend himself, but will switch to a Pulse Bow once the world is in Hardmode. The Revolver has a base 9% critical strike chance, as opposed to the usual 4%. Its best modifier is Unreal.


=== Loki's set ===
Description: Loki's set are vanity developer items that can be obtained rarely (5% chance) from Treasure Bags in Expert Mode. It is the vanity set made for Loki, the Community Manager at Re-Logic. Equipping the full set produces a pulsating effect similar to Adamantite armor, a glow similar to Spooky armor, and causes the armor to appear darker. Loki's equipment also includes these non-vanity items, which will drop in addition to his clothing set:


=== Golden Bullet ===
Description: Golden Bullets are one of six types of craftable ammunition made from Empty Bullets, which are sold by the Arms Dealer after Hardmode has been enabled. Like the Flask of Gold, they inflict the Midas debuff on enemies, causing them to drop 10%-50% more Coins when killed. Note that the debuff wears off after 2 seconds. The cost of a stack of 50 Golden Bullets is 1950, which is 39 per bullet. The cost of crafting 1000 Golden Bullets (20 stacks of 50) is 390.

=== Flameburst sentry summons ===
Description: The Flameburst Rod, Cane, and Staff are special sentry summon weapons. They can summon the Flameburst sentry, which lasts for 10 minutes / 2 minutes , remains stationary, and does not count against the player's minion capacity. Each Flameburst sentry is a short tower that fires fireballs at approaching enemies, which are non-piercing but can cause splash damage on impact which have a chance to inflict the Hellfire debuff. Unlike other projectile sentries, the Flameburst is unable to aim and shoot upward at an angle greater than 45°; flying enemies are therefore ignored when they fly above it. The Rod is sold by the Tavernkeep for 50000*5 , the Cane for 150000*15 , and Staff for 600000*60 . The Rod is always available. The Cane becomes available after defeating one Mechanical Boss, and the Staff becomes available after defeating Golem. The three different versions cause an identical effect, but with varying statistics, with the Staff being the most expensive and the most powerful. These weapons can only be used outside of the Old One's Army event after the event has been successfully completed. Completing the event on any difficulty allows Rods, Canes, and Staves alike to be used outside of the event. During the Old One's Army event, Etherian Mana can be collected, which allows the placement of multiple Flameburst Towers that remain permanently until the event is over. Etherian Mana cannot be used outside the event. Flameburst sentries are boosted by the Apprentice armor and Dark Artist armor set bonuses, which dramatically increase their range and field of view. Its best modifier is Mythical.

=== Adamantite Sword ===

It is the second best ore-crafted sword before the player is able to mine Chlorophyte. Like other Hardmode ore swords, it is capable of autoswing, despite having a rather broad appearance. Its best modifier is Legendary.

=== Fishing poles ===
Description: Fishing poles are used with bait for fishing. There are currently 11 / 9 different fishing poles, 4 of which are craftable, 4 are sold or awarded by NPCs, 1 is dropped by enemies and 2 / 1 found in Chests or crates.


=== Dye Vat ===
Description: The Dye Vat is a crafting station used to craft Dyes and some Paints. It is purchased from the Dye Trader for 5.


=== Flower Seeds ===
Description: Flower Seeds are seeds used to plant flowers on grass blocks. They can all be purchased from the Dryad for 5 each. They cannot be planted down when there is a wall above the grass block. However, it is possible to plant the seed then place a wall behind it. These plants can be destroyed by attacks.


=== Hallowed armor ===
Description: Hallowed armor is a Hardmode armor set. It has melee, ranged, magic, and summoner set versions, depending on the equipped headpiece. Crafting a full set with one headpiece requires 54 Hallowed Bars (dropped by the mechanical bosses), or 90 / 78 Hallowed Bars for the full set including all four / three headpieces. Wearing a full set gives off a faint pulsing aura around the player and displays an after-image effect while in motion. To acquire the necessary Hallowed Bars for a full set with one helmet, the player will need to kill at least 2 mechanical bosses, and all four helmets will require 3–5 kills on the PC, Console, Mobile, and tModLoader, or 2–4 kills on the Old-gen console, Windows Phone, Old Chinese, 3DS, and tModLoader Legacy for all three helmets. Additionally, wearing a full set while striking an enemy will grant the Holy Protection buff, which allows the player to dodge the next attack dealt by an enemy. It has a cooldown of 30 seconds, starting from when the last dodge was used. This set bonus is identical to the Shadow Dodge buff from Titanium armor. Wearing a full set with the Hallowed Hood additionally increases minion capacity by 2 as a set bonus, making the total minion capacity of the hood-set 3, for a total minion count of 4. It currently shares identical stats with Ancient Hallowed armor, but differs in appearance. Furthermore, Ancient Hallowed and Hallowed armor pieces can be mixed and matched while still providing their set bonus.

=== Active Stone Block ===
Description: Active Stone Blocks and Inactive Stone Blocks are blocks that act as mechanisms. A given pair behave as a single block whose presence can be switched "on" or "off" using wire and a trigger. When triggered, an Active Stone Block becomes an Inactive Stone Block, and vice versa. Wires must pass through all Active/Inactive Stone Blocks that are to be triggered, and the wires must connect to a trigger, such as a pressure plate, Switch, or timer. These blocks are useful for creating traps, floodgates, hidden passages, drawbridges (e.g. over water, lava, or empty space), skybridges, and much more. Both the Active and Inactive versions can be crafted. Players will usually want to craft the Active version, as the Inactive blocks cannot be placed next to each other without the support of other adjacent foreground blocks. Active blocks do not have this shortcoming, and switching them to Inactive afterwards using wires will still have the same outcome. Placing Active Stone Blocks, switching them to Inactive with wiring, then mining them and picking them up again, will yield Inactive blocks, and vice versa. Active/Inactive Stone Blocks occur naturally in Boulder traps found in the Cavern layer, where Active blocks that are wired to pressure plates suspend a Boulder in the ceiling. An enemy or player walking on the plate cause the Active blocks to turn Inactive, allowing the Boulder to fall through and damage any player below it.

=== Orichalcum armor ===
Description: Orichalcum armor is a Hardmode armor set and is the counterpart to Mythril armor. Like all Hardmode ore armors, Orichalcum armor has three different headwear options, allowing players to focus on magical, melee, or ranged combat, and each with a corresponding set bonus. Crafting a one-helmet set requires 54 Orichalcum Bars or 216 Orichalcum Ore. Crafting all five pieces requires 78 Orichalcum Bars or 312 Orichalcum Ore. Whenever the player strikes an enemy while wearing a full set, a flower petal is summoned at the edge of the screen and shoots to the other end of the screen. The flower petal will always be aimed at the enemy that triggered it, but it will damage any other enemy that it goes through. The flower petal has 36 base damage and can pierce, causing damage to multiple foes in a line with a single attack. Petals travel very quickly and pass through solid blocks and liquid with ease. There is a 20 frame cooldown before another flower petal can be summoned again, meaning that this set bonus adds roughly 100 DPS.

=== Panda Ears ===

=== Rainbow Crystal Staff ===
Description: The Rainbow Crystal Staff is a Hardmode, post-Moon Lord sentry summon weapon. It can summon the Rainbow Crystal sentry, which lasts for 10 minutes / 2 minutes , remains stationary, and does not count against the player's minion capacity. The Rainbow Crystal Staff has a 11.11*1/9 (11.11%) chance to be dropped by the Moon Lord. The Rainbow Crystal Staff summons a temporary crystal that deals high damage to enemies within its 60-tile range. Unlike other sentry summons, the crystal floats in midair at the cursor position when summoned, rather than falling to the ground. Attacks are animated as a spread of colored light beams targeting the closest enemy. The beams themselves do not do damage; damage is dealt only by delayed explosions at the end of the beams. Its best modifier is Ruthless. The Mythical modifier provides the widest array of stat bonuses, but these primarily affect the initial summon rather than the resulting minion. Additionally, minions cannot deal critical hits. The only lasting advantage a Mythical Rainbow Crystal Staff has over a Ruthless one is knockback.


=== Hardened Sand Walls ===
Description: The Hardened Sand Wall variants are natural background walls found in the Underground Desert. Underground Deserts generate by default the normal Hardened Sand Wall which may be converted into Hardened Ebon-, Crim-, and Pearlsand Wall if exposed to the Corruption, Crimson, and Hallow, respectively. Converted Hardened Sand Walls may further spread conversion. See biome spread for more information. On the PC version, Console version, Mobile version, and tModLoader version, all variants can be crafted.

While it lacks autoswing and has a slow swing speed, it has the second-longest reach and second-highest damage of all swords in Pre-Hardmode. It generates a small explosion whenever it hits an enemy, dealing extra damage to the original target and nearby enemies, and it has a 50*1/2 (50%) chance per individual hit to inflict the On Fire! debuff for 3 seconds. It emits fiery light particles when swung. It is one of the key ingredients in crafting the Night's Edge and one of the most powerful pre-hardmode weapons. Its best modifier is Legendary.

It can be dyed and some vanity items are visible when transformed, but certain accessories cannot be used, such as wings.


=== Decay Chamber ===
Description: The Decay Chamber is a Hardmode crafting station used to craft lesion-themed (Corruption) furniture from Lesion Blocks. It is purchased from the Steampunker for 10, but only appears for sale in worlds that are generated with the Corruption. It can also be crafted from the Flesh Cloning Vat, its Crimson counterpart.

=== Angel Halo ===
Description: The Angel Halo is a vanity accessory rarely sold for 40by the Traveling Merchant. The Angel Halo cannot be reforged, and therefore cannot have modifiers.


=== Team Blocks ===
Description: Team Blocks are decorative blocks purchased from the Traveling Merchant for 1 each. Team Blocks are available in six different colors, each representing one of the six team colors selectable in the player's inventory, including white for the neutral team. Unlike Team Dye and Team Hair Dye, these blocks have no special function and are always the same color. The Traveling Merchant will only ever sell one color of Team Block at a time, along with the Team Platform of the same color, meaning that multiple visits will be required to collect all colors.


=== Bottle ===
Description: A Bottle is a crafting material required to craft most potions. Like the Pink Vase, Mug, and different Cups, placing it (on most "flat surface items" or a platform) allows it to act as a Placed Bottle where the player can craft potions. Bottles can also be "filled" when standing near water or honey, turning them into Bottled Water or Bottled Honey, respectively. Bottles can be crafted from Glass and found in chests.

=== Shroomite armor ===
Description: Shroomite Armor is a Hardmode, post-Plantera armor set that boosts the effectiveness of ranged weapons. It is available after defeating Plantera and is the second-strongest ranger armor available, only beaten by Vortex armor () or Titan armor (). With a full set equipped, standing still causes a player to enter "stealth mode": Over the course of roughly 1.5 seconds, the player will gradually turn almost fully transparent, which also diminishes the chance that enemies will target the player. Additionally, during this time, weapon damage, critical strike chance, and knockback will each be boosted gradually up to a maximum of +60% damage, +10% critical chance, and +50% knockback at full stealth. These boosts increase both weapon and ammo damage. The buff begins fading quickly if the wearer starts moving. Shroomite armor has three headpiece options, each providing an extra ×1.15 damage boost that affects a different ranged weapon type: Note that this increase is applied after applying damage increases from the rest of the armor set, accessories and buffs. As a result, Shroomite headpieces provide a larger damage bonus than their tooltip would suggest. Some ranged weapons do not receive the specialized boost from any of the three options (e.g. Star Cannon, Piranha Gun and Flamethrower), though they still receive the set stealth boost. A full set of Shroomite armor will provide the following stats: Crafting Shroomite Armor requires Shroomite Bars (crafted from Chlorophyte Bars via the Autohammer, which is in turn purchased from the Truffle NPC). Crafting a full set with a single headpiece requires 54 Shroomite Bars (or 810 Glowing Mushrooms and 270 / 324 Chlorophyte Ores). A full set with all three headpieces requires 78 Shroomite Bars (1170 Glowing Mushrooms and 390 / 468 Chlorophyte Ores).

=== Sandstone Blocks ===
Description: Sandstone Blocks are found naturally-placed in the Underground Desert biome. Sandstone blocks don't affect whether an area qualifies as an Underground Desert biome.

Like Sand and Hardened Sand, it is a corruptable block in Hardmode, and has Corruption, Crimson, and Hallowed counterparts: Ebonsandstone, Crimsandstone, and Pearlsandstone respectively. It can be crafted into Smooth Sandstone, which then can be crafted into various furniture items.

On the Old-gen console version and Windows Phone version, the colors are inverted. The Plumber's Hat has a 1/250 (0.4%) chance to be dropped by Fire Imps. The shirt and pants are purchased from the Clothier for 25 each, during a full moon. If you’re looking to get the Plumber’s Hat, despite the chances being worse from statues, an easy way to get it would be to place down a few Imp Statues and farm it that way. These items are purely vanity items and provide no increase in defense or other bonuses.


=== Robot set ===
Description: The Robot set is a set of vanity items consisting of the Robot Mask, Robot Shirt, and Robot Pants. Its male and female variants are identical.

The Boomstick has a stronger and less accurate pre-Hardmode upgrade, the Quad-Barrel Shotgun, and a Hardmode upgrade, the Shotgun. Its best modifier is Unreal.


=== Ebonwood ===
Description: Ebonwood is The Corruption replacement for normal wood. Its properties are generally the same as that of normal wood, but it has the characteristic dark purple tint of the Corruption. It is obtained by cutting down trees within the Corruption. Ebonwood has better attributes than something made of normal wood (example: normal wood sword does 7 damage, while an Ebonwood sword does 10 damage). Ebonwood is the second best wood for crafting equipment (tools and weapons), but is the third best for the variants of wood armors, only being beaten by Pearlwood and Spooky Wood, as it has higher damage, defense and tool power than most other woods. Ebonwood, along with Shadewood, is the best wood for tools, weapons, and armor, before entering Hardmode. Trees that have grown in The Corruption will give Ebonwood instead of normal wood. Palm trees that have grown on Ebonsand will give this wood instead of Palm Wood, as there is no Corruption variant of Palm Wood. Ebonwood cannot spread the Corruption. Ebonwood (except for texture) is the exact same as Shadewood.

Lihzahrd Power Cells are utilized by simply using the ⚷ Interact button on a Lihzahrd Altar, which automatically consumes one Lihzahrd Power Cell from the player's inventory and spawns Golem immediately. On all versions, Golem may only be summoned in worlds where Plantera has been defeated; otherwise, the summoning will fail, and a Lihzahrd Power Cell will not be consumed from the player's inventory.

When equipped, it will give the selected accessory/armor a silver-plated, "shiny" effect, reflecting the surrounding light around the player. The reflection is more pronounced the closer the player is to a light source. The dye will prioritize light from the sun when the player is outside. From some perspectives, the player may look 3D when this dye is equipped all over. As with other reflective dyes, this dye is not animated when standing still, but the shading on a dyed piece of equipment will change according to the surrounding light, giving it the appearance of light reflecting off of a shining metallic object.

It combines the functionalities of its ingredients, granting the ability to swim, breathe for an extended time, and emit light underwater (in the PC version, Console version, Mobile version, and tModLoader version, it gives a very faint glow out of water and honey and its brightness is significantly increased when submerged) and additionally slowing the rate at which damage from drowning is taken. Apart from combining these effects into a single accessory, it does not have other unique properties.

=== Umbrella ===
Description: The Umbrella is a held item, and on PC, Console, Mobile, and tModLoader, a melee weapon as well.

It is one tier below Silver, but it is one tier above Tin. Like all hammers, it is used to remove background walls and create sloped tiles and half tiles. Its best modifier is Legendary. While Light may seem to provide a better speed boost by percentages, rounding reveals that Legendary and Light mine at equal speeds for this tool.

=== Bug Net ===
Description: The Bug Net is a tool used to capture certain critters as inventory items. It is swung like a broadsword, but it deals no damage. The Bug Net is nearly required in order to go fishing, as it is the initial and primary method of obtaining bait. Most critters that are insects, worms, or snails can function as bait once captured. The Bug Net is purchased from the Merchant for 25 / 1. The Lavaproof Bug Net and the Golden Bug Net are upgraded versions that are bigger, swing faster, and can destroy tall grass, vines, and uproot plants just like swords and other weapons do, despite dealing no damage.

It takes a total of 48 / 60 Tin Bars to craft a full suit, or 144 / 180 Tin Ore. A full set grants a basic 5 defense plus a set bonus of 2 defense, which equals a total of 7 defense.

=== Death Sickle ===
Description: The Death Sickle is a Hardmode auto-swinging melee weapon that fires a large, short-range, spinning sickle projectile at no mana or ammo cost, which travels through blocks. The projectile travels approximately 12 tiles, emits a small amount of light, and can pierce 4 enemies. It is dropped by Reapers during the Solar Eclipse event with a 2.5*1/40 (2.5%) / 3.7*1/27 (3.7%) / 0.4*1/250 (0.4%) chance. Its best modifier is Legendary.


=== Last Prism ===
Description: Last Prism is a Hardmode, post-Moon Lord magic weapon that has a 11.11*1/9 (11.11%) chance of dropping from the Moon Lord. It fires several beams of light that converge into one focused beam as it charges, dealing massive damage. It has one of the highest base DPS levels in the game at the cost of rapidly consuming mana. The Last Prism projects 6 beams that deal individual damage as they begin to rotate, then spin faster as they converge into one thick beam. This process takes exactly 3.365 seconds, each beam continuing to deal the weapon's full listed damage. The fully-converged beam deals 3 times the listed damage, or 300 damage per hit. Unlike most piercing attacks, the weapon hits 12 times per second (every 5 game ticks[1]). The mana cost will increase sharply as the beam converges. Due to its high mana cost (144 mana per second; 12 mana 12 times per second when fully charged), players will struggle to maintain the beam for more than 1-2 seconds. Usage of the Mana Flower, Magic Cuffs, Nebula armor, and a large supply of Super Mana Potions with the Last Prism is necessary for longer use. When combining the Last Prism's base damage of 100 with Accessories such as the Celestial Emblem, Sorcerer Emblem, Avenger Emblem, and other damage boosters such as Nebula armor or the clairvoyance buff from the Crystal Ball, it is possible to double the damage output. Its best modifier is Mythical.


=== Biome Sight Potion ===

It is also the strongest set that is made from ore which can be mined from the start (with a Copper Pickaxe) It consists of a Platinum Helmet, Platinum Chainmail and Platinum Greaves. A full set grants a basic 16 defense plus a set bonus of 4 defense, which equals a total of 20 defense, 4 more than gold, making it noticeably stronger. It is a viable alternative to Shadow armor or Crimson armor for entering Hardmode, if the player wants 1 extra defense.

=== Encumbering Stone ===
Description: The Encumbering Stone is a pre-Hardmode item that prevents item pickup while inside the character's inventory. It is sometimes found in Sandstone Chests in the Underground Desert. While in the inventory, the Encumbering Stone will prevent the pickup of any items, even if you already have a stackable item in your inventory. This can be very useful while farming events or mining out hellevators. The Encumbering Stone will also prevent the entry of items into Void Bags. Items reeled in from fishing are still placed in the player's inventory. Hearts and Stars will also be picked up even with the Encumbering Stone in the inventory.


=== Piranha Gun ===
Description: The Piranha Gun is a Hardmode post-Plantera ranged weapon that fires three / a single returning Mechanical Piranha projectile(s) that costs no ammunition. The mechanical fish will stick onto an enemy to do continuous damage while the ⚒ Use / Attack button is held. Each can target different enemies, or the same one, if there are too few nearby. If the initial target is killed and the button is still held, the projectiles will seek out nearby enemies. It returns to the gun once no other enemies are in the vicinity, when the button is released, or after one minute of continuous use. The Piranha Gun is found in the Dungeon's Jungle Chest, which requires the Jungle Key to open, and only after Plantera has been defeated. The first enemy the piranha attaches to must be in direct line of sight. However, any other nearby enemy besides the first target will not require a line of sight. It hits 7.5 times per second and deals damage in a very small area, meaning that if other enemies get too close they can also be damaged simultaneously. Its best modifier is Unreal. Because its attack speed is unaffected by modifiers, Godly and Demonic can also be considered the best modifiers for a Piranha Gun.


=== Amber Staff ===
Description: The Amber Staff is a pre-Hardmode magic weapon. It functions as a gem staff, firing a light-emitting projectile that can pierce 1 enemy. Like the other high-tier gem staves, it can autofire. Its best modifier is Mythical.

Like other bows, it uses arrows as ammo. It does not convert used arrows into special arrows. Its best modifier is Demonic, as it does not have any knockback and thus cannot get modifiers that affect it. It can also get the Deadly modifier, which, while the Demonic modifier may provide the greatest damage per hit, grants a higher increase to the overall DPS.

A full set of Squire armor provides the following benefits: The set bonus increases the velocity of the Ballista sentry summons and increases their penetration from 4 to 7. It also gives the wearer the Ballista Panic! buff upon taking any damage, which doubles the fire rate of all Ballista sentries summoned by the player for 5 seconds. The total bonus to max number of sentries is +2, allowing 3 to be summoned at once. The Valhalla Knight armor can be considered a direct upgrade of the Squire armor.


=== Royal set ===
Description: The Royal set is a Hardmode vanity set consisting of the Royal Tiara, Royal Blouse, and the Royal Dress. It is purchased from the Princess for 150 (set).


=== Gemspark Walls ===
Description: Gemspark Walls are the wall equivalent of Gemspark Blocks, and come in Online and Offline variants. Like Gemspark Blocks, Online Gemspark Walls emit light but do not count as a light source for NPC housing. Unlike Gemspark Blocks, Gemspark Walls do not act as Mechanisms and their online and offline states cannot be switched after being placed.

PC version, Console version, Mobile version, Old Chinese version, tModLoader version, and tModLoader 1.3-Legacy version Old-gen console version, Windows Phone version, and Nintendo 3DS version


=== Piggy Bank ===
Description: The Piggy Bank is the first of the "personal storage items" that can be purchased from the Merchant for 1. Like other storage items (eg. Chests), it contains 40 slots (4 rows of 10) that can be used to store anything. The Piggy Bank requires only a space 2 wide and 1 high for placement, but must be placed on a Work Bench, Table, or Platforms (in contrast, the Safe, Defender's Forge, and Void Vault can be placed on blocks, but are considerably larger). The Piggy Bank inventory can also be accessed via the Money Trough, which summons a temporary floating version of the Piggy Bank. Unlike normal chests etc, the Piggy bank (along with the Safe, Defender's Forge, and Void Vault) is considered "personal storage". Items contained in a Piggy Bank are attached to the character rather than to a container in the world: The bank can be picked up and moved regardless of the items within. Coins and items stored within it are safe from other players, and will not be dropped on death. They will even travel with a character who goes to a different world. However, if a Hardcore character dies, all items in their personal storage will be deleted with the character (and lost forever). The Piggy Bank (as well as the Safe, Defender's Forge, and Void Vault) functions similarly to other storage items, but with some important differences:


=== Minecart Track ===
Description: Minecart Tracks are placeable furniture-type blocks that allow for rapid transportation over long distances. They form a continuous track when placed next to each other, and form slopes when placed diagonally. Although they cannot be walked on, they can be grappled using a hook. When the player is near a Minecart Track, pressing the Quick Mount hotkey or pressing the ⚷ Interact key on a point on the track causes a Minecart to spawn, which the player is automatically placed in. Once inside, the ▶ Right and ◀ Left direction keys either accelerate, decelerate, or reverse the cart's movement. The cart will maintain its current speed and direction if no keys are pressed and no obstacles are reached. The cart can also "jump" with the ↷ Jump key. To exit the Minecart (which causes the Minecart to despawn), the player can use a hook, press the Quick Mount hotkey, or cancel the buff ( right-clicking the icon, selecting the icon and canceling it in the equipment menu, double-tapping the icon, or canceling the buff from the buffs screen). The Minecart will also despawn if the player jumps off the tracks, lands on blocks, and attempts to move sideways. Weapons and tools, as well as most other items except hooks, can be used while riding a Minecart. The Booster Track is purchased from the Mechanic for 50. Minecart Tracks will always spawn at least a Wooden Minecart when mounted. In order to travel faster or add capabilities, a Minecart variant can be placed in the minecart equipment slot of the player's inventory, which will replace the default Minecart. Nearly all Minecarts have identical speed, acceleration, and so on, differing only in appearance (some produce trails or other visual effects). However, a few of them do vary in speed or add capabilities: When the end of the track is reached, the minecart will follow one of three behaviors, depending on the state of the final track tile. The final track tile can be shaped using a hammer, which will cause it to cycle through closed, open, and bumper states. Two separate intersecting track lines can be connected together into an intersection, using a hammer, which will then be capable of allowing a minecart to switch from one track to the other. The player can switch tracks on-the-fly by holding the ▲ Up or ▼ Down key as they travel through an intersection. Minecart Tracks naturally occur in Abandoned Mine Tracks, spawning underground in long, continuous paths. The length and number of Abandoned Mine Tracks found in a world is proportional to its size, see World size for a detailed comparison. These tracks will always have sufficient clearance for a player in a cart to ride from beginning to end unhindered, and often connect multiple larger cave systems. Note that the journey is not guaranteed to be safe. While driving the character is likely to bump into enemies, and the tracks may also lead through liquids like lava. On the PC version, Console version, Mobile version, and tModLoader version, there may also be a Pressure Plate Track wired to a trap. Some Abandoned Mine Tracks generate extra long, roughly 3 times longer than standard tracks and can span across multiple biomes.

Crafting the full set requires a total of 36 Luminite Bars (144 Luminite) and 45 Vortex Fragments. A full set of the Vortex armor will provide the following benefits: Additionally, equipping a full set grants the player the ability to toggle stealth mode, which gradually increases the player's stats, and finally offers the following benefits: Unlike Shroomite armor, standing still is not required to enter Vortex armor's stealth mode. Instead, it is toggled manually by double-tapping the ▼ Down key. Moving or grappling does not cancel the effect, and like Shroomite armor, its stealth bonuses are applied to all ranged weapon types. Dashing with items such as the Shield of Cthulhu or Tabi, or riding a Mount will cancel stealth mode. Stealth mode cannot be activated while on a mount.

Description: The Lesser Healing Potion is a healing item that restores 50 health when used. As its name suggests, it heals the least amount of health of all Healing Potions. In addition to being crafted, Lesser Healing Potions can also be found naturally in pots (only before Hardmode), generated chests, Wooden and Pearlwood Crates, and dropped by most pre-Hardmode bosses. Lesser Healing Potions can also be purchased for 3 from the Merchant, or from the Skeleton Merchant during moon phases 2, 4, 6, and 8: Naturally-placed Lesser Healing Potions appear frequently on platforms in the Dungeon (along with Lesser Mana Potions). When encountered in placed form, they function as Placed Bottle crafting stations. They also show the "bottle" tooltip on the map.

Description: Gem Squirrels are harmless critters that can be caught with any Bug Net and do not normally interact with the player in any other way, except in that they can be killed by both players and enemies. They have 5 health and usually serve as ambient entities in Terraria. Gem Squirrels spawn near towns in the cavern layer and Gem Trees that can be planted with Gemcorns. Their surface counterparts are Squirrels. Most naturally spawned Gem Squirrels can be caught with a Bug Net, and carried in the player's inventory (or placed in storage). If a squirrel caught with any Bug Net is taken from inventory and "used" (placed), it is again released into the environment at the cursor and behaves as usual.

=== Pink Slime Block ===
Description: The Pink Slime Block can be created with Pink Gel if the player is near a Solidifier. Landing on a Pink Slime Block causes the player to bounce. Pink Slime Blocks negate fall damage when the player lands on one. Like with Slime Blocks, running over Pink Slime Blocks produces droplet particles. The height of the bounce is dependent on the player's speed, not on the distance they've fallen. Holding a Portal Gun or riding the Slime Mount can allow for higher bounce due to the higher speed limit.

Destroying the Larva summons the Queen Bee. Any projectile, tool, weapon, or enemy will destroy the Larva with a single hit, so caution should be taken around the Larva if the player is not ready to fight the Queen Bee. The number of bee hives per world is dependent on world size: there are usually 6-8 hives in Small or Medium worlds, and 11-16 hives in Large worlds.[1]

=== Gold Chest ===
Description: The Gold Chest is a naturally-generated chest, with various loot as its contents. Each chest includes one special item, as well as some coins and other more common items. Gold Chests are found in Underground Cabins in the Underground, Cavern, and Underground Jungle, and are also found as Locked Gold Chests in the Dungeon. Locked Gold Chests require one Golden Key each to open. Apart from the initial items, Gold Chests function identically to other chests. Removing all items from a Gold Chest will allow it to be freed or broken with a pickaxe or drill. It can then be picked up, placed, and used just like any other chest, with 40 slots of storage space. There are only three minor differences to other chests: Gold Chests cannot be crafted and are only generated on world creation at the random locations; they can also be sold to an NPC at 10, which is more than the standard chest, which only sells for 1. Gold Chests have a sparkle effect when exposed to a light source, similar to coins. The loot for any given chest is determined by the location in which it is found. Each chest contains a single primary item and an assortment of randomly chosen common items. The primary item is first placed in the chest, then each "set" of common items is checked to see whether or not it will be added. If a set is chosen to be added, a single item from the list is added to the chest. Sets are displayed in the list below divided by horizontal borders. For example, the Wooden Arrow and the Shuriken both reside in the same set, so they will never both appear in the same chest.

Description: The Ash Block is a block that covers the upper and lower sections of The Underworld, and can occasionally encase Hellstone. It can be used for building and for growing Fireblossom.

=== Nebula armor ===
Description: Nebula armor is a post-Moon Lord armor set that provides magic weapon boosts. It is currently the final magic set available on the PC version, Console version, Mobile version, Old Chinese version, tModLoader version, and tModLoader 1.3-Legacy version. Crafting this set requires a total of 36 Luminite Bars (144 Luminite) and 45 Nebula Fragments. A full set of the Nebula armor will provide the following benefits: Additionally, equipping the full set grants a chance that special booster items will appear when striking enemies with magic weapons / any projectile (which includes minions). Each booster grants a buff that lasts 8 seconds and causes a spark effect to float around the player. When a booster item is picked up while an identical buff is already in effect, it stacks with the previous buff, for up to 3 stacked boosts. Every 8 seconds, one stacked booster expires and the buff decreases by one level. Booster items float in the air and have a greater pickup range than most items. In multiplayer, any player can pick up these booster items and benefit from their buffs, even if they are not wearing Nebula armor. Additionally, picking up a booster item will grant nearby players (within a 43.75-tile radius[1]) one instance of the buff. If the player acquiring the booster is on a team, only other players within that team will obtain the buff; otherwise, unaffiliated players will spread the buff to all other nearby players upon obtaining a booster.

When a lamp is turned on and off slowly (more than 1 game tick apart) the gate will NOT emit a puff particle, this means that the gate will output 1 pulse when it is turned on, and ANOTHER pulse when it is turned off. This above functionality enables the creation of mechanisms similar to electrical diodes, and transistors.

The Rainbow Gun is found in the Dungeon's Hallowed Chest, which must be unlocked with a Hallowed Key. Its best modifier is Ruthless. The Mythical modifier provides the widest array of stat bonuses, but the only stats that improve damage output are damage and critical chance. Switching to a different magic weapon causes existing projectiles to use that weapon's critical chance instead, meaning that the Rainbow Gun's DPS is optimized with the Ruthless modifier when used in the intended way.


=== Chlorophyte armor ===
Description: Chlorophyte armor is a Hardmode armor set available after defeating all three mechanical bosses. It can be considered a partial upgrade of Hallowed armor, granting more defense and being geared more towards high ranged and magic damage output.

The projectile is capped at 100 damage. The Leaf Crystal is capable of firing two separate simultaneous volleys of projectiles. Each volley fires every 0.67 / 0.83 seconds. It is possible for both volleys to target the same enemy. A full set of Chlorophyte armor requires 54 Chlorophyte Bars, or 270 / 324 Chlorophyte Ore.

As with its Corruption counterpart, the Ebonstone, Crimstone can be converted into ordinary Stone via Purification Powder or Green Solution used by the Clentaminator. Ordinary stone, Ebonstone and Pearlstone can be converted to Crimstone by using Vicious Powder or Red Solution used by the Clentaminator. In Hardmode, the spread of Crimson converts ordinary Stone blocks into Crimstone. Crimstone itself also spreads Crimson to susceptible blocks nearby. Crimstone can be crafted into Flesh Blocks at a Meat Grinder, which can then be crafted into furniture. It can also be crafted into Crimstone Bricks.

=== Star Princess set ===
Description: The Star Princess set is a vanity set consisting of the Star Princess Crown and Star Princess Dress. These items are to be equipped in the Social Slots as they only provide a visual appearance. They are purchased from the Traveling Merchant for 1 (set), and is always sold along with the Celestial Wand.


=== Ice Machine ===
Description: The Ice Machine is a crafting station that has a 14.29*1/7 (14.29%) chance of spawning in Frozen Chests. On PC version, Console version, Mobile version, and tModLoader version, it can be purchased from the Steampunker for 10 while in the Snow biome. It is used to craft ice-themed furniture from Ice Blocks.


=== Wooden Spike ===
Description: Wooden Spikes are a type of trap block that damage players who come in contact with it. They are the upgrade of regular, metal Spikes, and, despite their name and appearance suggesting that they are made of a weaker material, they deal more damage than the metal variant; players that touch Wooden Spikes take 60 / 80 damage. Found in the Jungle Temple, they can be broken with any drill, pickaxe, or explosive ( like other types of traps), unlike the Lihzahrd Bricks found around them, which require a Picksaw or stronger mining tool to break. This is the only way to obtain them, as they are not craftable.


=== Sailfish Boots ===
Description: Sailfish Boots are an accessory that allows the user to sprint. This item is obtained from Wooden Crates and Iron Crates. When equipped, they allow the player to gain a speed boost after running for a certain distance continuously. By running in one direction, the player's movement speed increases up to 40%. (See Sprinting accessories for more information on the sprint effect.) The Sailfish Boots, Hermes Boots, Dunerider Boots, and the Flurry Boots have identical functionality, with their only differences being aesthetic (and being faster on Sand Blocks, in the case of the Dunerider Boots). In the case of the Sailfish Boots, the user will generate water particles coming out of their backs while running. All four listed boots are interchangeable when crafting Spectre Boots.

=== Axe of Regrowth ===
Description: The Axe of Regrowth is a pre-hardmode weapon crafted from a Staff of Regrowth. Like the Staff of Regrowth, it increases the yield of any herbs and seeds harvested. When used on Dirt Blocks, Grass will be planted without the need for seeds. When used to chop down trees, an acorn will automatically be planted in the same spot. When harvesting plants from Clay Pots or Planter Boxes, only blooming herbs that would drop seeds can be cut. When harvesting plants from natural blocks in Singleplayer mode, immature sprouts will be destroyed and plants that are fully grown but not in bloom will drop seeds. Its best modifier is Light for harvesting purposes and Legendary for combat purposes.

=== Biome Keys ===
Description: Biome Keys are Hardmode items used to open the Biome Chests in the Dungeon. Opening a Chest consumes the key. Though unusable until Plantera is defeated, they can be dropped at any time during Hardmode. On the PC version, Console version, Mobile version, Old Chinese version, tModLoader version, and tModLoader 1.3-Legacy version, each key has a 0.04*1/2500 (0.04%) chance of dropping from an enemy in the key's respective biome. On the Old-gen console version, Windows Phone version, and Nintendo 3DS version, they are not dropped directly and must be crafted from Biome Key Molds. Any enemy in the biome that drops coins when killed has a chance of dropping a key, not just biome-exclusive enemies. Additionally, enemies in hybrid biomes have a chance to drop any key from their composite biomes. The type of key is determined by which biome the player currently is in, not the enemy killed. Any Biome Key obtained prior to defeating Plantera will display the tooltip "It has been cursed by a powerful Jungle creature" and will be unable to open its respective chest until Plantera is defeated, although they are usable in other worlds that have Plantera defeated already.

=== Frost armor ===
Description: The Frost armor is a Hardmode armor set that grants the ability to inflict Frostbite / Frostburn on enemies with melee or ranged attacks when the whole set is worn, as well as causing all ranged and melee attacks to give off light. Frostbite is a variant of the Frostburn debuff that deals 25 DPS instead of 8. On the PC version, Console version, Old-gen console version, Mobile version, Windows Phone version, Old Chinese version, tModLoader version, and tModLoader 1.3-Legacy version, the Ice Golem will drop a Frost Core, required to craft one piece of Frost armor. On the Nintendo 3DS version, Ice Golems will drop a random piece of Frost armor. Visually, wearing the set causes a "snow trail" to be left behind the player as they walk, similar to running with Hermes Boots. Also, the sound when player takes damage is replaced with the shattering soundhttps://terraria.fandom.com/wiki/File:Item_27.wav heard when breaking through Thin Ice. The Desert's Forbidden armor is the counterpart to this armor set, buffing magic and summon abilities instead of melee and ranged. It takes 46 Adamantite or Titanium Bars (Hallowed in the Old-gen console version) as well as 3 Frost Cores to craft a full set of Frost armor. A full set of Frost armor will provide the following benefits:

=== Snake Charmer's Flute ===
Description: The Snake Charmer's Flute is an item that summons a climbable snake. When used, it places a pot that a snake rises from. Once the snake reaches its full height of 100 blocks or touches a block, it stops rising and becomes climbable like a Rope. It is also possible to place blocks against it when it is fully extended, and as such, it is possible to climb to the top of the Space layer by alternating between using the flute and blocks. The snake and the pot disappear after approximately 25 seconds. It also produces a small amount of light. It can be found in the Sandstone Chests in the Underground Desert biome, or from Oasis Crates and Mirage Crates.


=== Silver Bar ===
Description: The Silver Bar is an early-game metal bar, used to create the Silver tier of equipment. Its alternate ore version is the Tungsten Bar. It can also be placed on the ground, like furniture. Crafting all items (excluding bullets) requires 151 / 159 / 141 Silver Bars; this translates to 604 / 636 / 564 Silver Ore.

=== Obsidian Swordfish ===
Description: The Obsidian Swordfish is a Hardmode spear. It has the second-highest base damage of any spear (beaten only by the North Pole). However, it is very short compared to other Hardmode spears. It is obtained via fishing in lava, by using any lava fishing method (including lava bait or Lavaproof Fishing Hook) during Hardmode, or only by using the Hotline Fishing Hook. The Obsidian Swordfish has an extraordinarily high base critical strike chance of 24% as opposed to the usual 4%. This gives it not only the highest base critical strike chance of any melee weapon, but also the second highest of any weapon, tied with the Sky Fracture and surpassed only by the Sniper Rifle. Its best modifier is Godly or Demonic. Both modifiers increase the average damage output by the same amount.


=== Platinum Ore ===
Description: Platinum Ore is an early-game ore that spawns in the Underground and Cavern layers, as well as on Floating Islands. Its primary use is in crafting Platinum Bars, which are used to make the fourth tier of equipment and several other items. Platinum Ore is the counterpart to Gold Ore, which can generate in its place in some worlds. Platinum Ore has a small chance to appear as a bonus drop from slimes.

=== Ghostar's set ===
Description: Ghostar's set are vanity developer items that can be obtained rarely (5% chance) from Treasure Bags in Expert Mode. It is the vanity set made for Ghostar, one of the production assistants at Re-Logic. Ghostar's equipment also includes this non-vanity item, which will drop in addition to her clothing set:


=== Ebonwood Sword ===
Description: The Ebonwood Sword is an alternate version of the Wooden Sword made using Ebonwood from the Corruption Biome. It is functionally identical to its Crimson equivalent, the Shadewood Sword, with both dealing more damage and having slightly increased speed than the Wooden Sword and its variants (aside from the hardmode Pearlwood Sword). With it being stronger than the other wooden swords, it can be useful early on, though one should proceed with caution, as the Corruption is a very dangerous place for new players. Its best modifier is Legendary.

=== Jim's set ===
Description: Jim's set are vanity developer items that can be obtained rarely (5% chance) from Treasure Bags in Expert Mode. It is the vanity set made for Jimmarn, an artist who develops graphics for Terraria. Equipping the full set produces a glow effect similar to Spooky armor and grants an after-image movement effect similar to Ninja armor. Jimmarn's equipment also includes the non-vanity Jim's Wings, which will drop in addition to his clothing set.


=== Yoraiz0r's Spell ===
Description: Yoraiz0r's Spell is a developer wing type. Like other developer wings, Yoraiz0r's Spell is acquired along with Yoraiz0r's set when they drop from a Hardmode Treasure Bag in Expert Mode (1/20 (5%) chance of a random developer set dropping). Yoraiz0r's Spell is unique in that it functions as wings but displays no wing or other item graphic. It instead displays a rocket effect similar to the Rocket Boots, while still offering controlled flight, as well as glide time after flight time has been exhausted. It also offers the ability to hover at a fixed height via the ▼ Down+↷ Jump keys. Yoraiz0r's Spell grants unique visuals that can be altered in unusual ways: It causes the player's eyes to glow red, along with a motion streak. The intensity of the eye glow and streak are determined by which accessory or social slot the Spell is equipped in: No glow is present if placed in the top slot, while a pronounced glow and long streak appear if placed in the fifth slot (even more so when equipped in the sixth or seventh slots). The color and effect of the eye glow can be altered by the pet dye slot in the equipment tab, while those of the Rocket Boots-style particles emitted when flying can be altered separately via the accessory dye slot. When dyed with the Twilight Dye, Phase Dye, Living Ocean Dye, or Living Flame Dye, the rocket effect disappears and the player flies with only the eye glow. Yoraiz0r's Spell also causes the player to emit a faint amount of light, if placed in a main accessory slot rather than a social (vanity) slot, and if the slot is set to visible. The light level is similarly affected by which accessory slot the Spell is equipped in, with the most light emitted when equipped in the sixth / seventh slot (and with it, the least emitted light when in the first slot).


=== Joja Cola ===
Description: The Joja Cola is a food item that grants the Well Fed buff when consumed. This lasts for 2 minutes, but can be canceled at any time by selecting the icon and canceling it in the equipment menu () or by double-tapping the buff icon (). It has a 12.5*1/8 (12.5%) chance of being fished up instead of a junk item when fishing. If this item is within a player's inventory near the Dryad, she will comment on it when the player interacts with her. If you have the item held, the player will be prompted to give the Joja Cola to the Dryad to purify it. This will trigger a sequence in which a portal will open, allowing the player to peek into the world of Stardew Valley for a few seconds. Afterwards, an item called a Stardrop will be given to the player. This item will summon the pet Junimo. Like all other food items, it can be placed on a Plate: .


=== Mud Wall ===
Description: Mud Walls are naturally-occurring background walls found in the Jungle and occasionally the Underground Jungle. Naturally generated Mud Walls can be destroyed with a hammer, but drop nothing. On the PC version, Console version, Mobile version, and tModLoader version they can however be crafted. If natural Mud Walls are sprayed with Dark Blue Solution they will turn into "natural" Mushroom Walls that likewise don't drop anything when destroyed. If these Mushroom Walls are sprayed with Green Solution they will revert back into Mud Walls or natural Jungle Walls, this seemingly being determined by layer level.

Description: Jellyfish Jars are animated decorative items. They can be placed on top of solid blocks and platforms, and give off a faint light. Do note that the Jellyfish needed to craft these decorations are obtained by fishing, not by killing the actual Jellyfish enemies. Jellyfish jars function as valid light sources for houses, illuminate underwater, but are not controllable mechanisms like some other light sources.

The Vest and Trousers can be crafted, while the Gentleman's Beard can be bought from the Stylist for 5. When equipped in an accessory slot, the Gentleman's Beard will grow longer over time. After 12 minutes of being equipped, the beard has a 11.11*1/9 (11.11%) chance every second to grow to the next stage. This growth is not affected by speeding up time, and will not occur when the beard is equipped in a vanity slot. The beard also changes colors based on the player's hair color.

=== Water Strider ===
Description: The Water Strider is a harmless critter that spawns on bodies of water on the Surface during the day. It only spawns near Sand and Jungle grass blocks, but not in the Ocean biome. It will not spawn if the wind speed exceeds 20 mph. The Water Strider moves by gliding on water and hopping around on land. Due to having only 5 health and no defense, it is often killed instantly by enemies or players. Gold Water Striders have a 0.67*1/150 (0.67%) chance to spawn in place of the regular variant. It can be caught with any Bug Net to be carried around in the inventory and released later, or crafted into a Water Strider Cage to be used as decorative furniture. Once crafted, the caged Water Strider cannot be released again, and when placed down it moves around inside the cage as it would do outside. The Bestiary entry for the Water Strider: "Glides elegantly along the surface of calm bodies of water searching for smaller bugs. Fish are occasionally attracted to these."


=== Depth Meter ===
Description: The Depth Meter is an informational accessory that displays the player's depth. It is required to craft the GPS, which can then be used to craft the PDA and the Cell Phone. The Depth Meter is dropped by Cave Bats, Giant Bats, Jungle Bats, Spore Bats, and Ice Bats, with a chance of 1*1/100 (1%) / 0.5*1/200 (0.5%) . On the PC, Console, Mobile, Old Chinese, tModLoader, and tModLoader Legacy versions, it also drops from Salamanders, Giant Shellys, and Crawdads, with a chance of 1.25*1/80 (1.25%). In the Old-gen console version, the Depth Meter may also be crafted. Depth is measured relative to the boundary between the Surface and Underground layers, which has a depth of 0 and is displayed as "Level". The display shows the vertical distance to this line and the name of the current layer.

=== Endless Quiver ===
Description: The Endless Quiver is a Hardmode item that acts as ammunition, and can be placed in the ammo slots in the player's inventory. While in the user's inventory, it acts as a single Wooden Arrow that can be fired from any appropriate bow or repeater without being depleted. Bows that convert arrows into special types will fire their special shots indefinitely, including those such as The Bee's Knees that specifically require Wooden Arrows for their specialized shot types to work. Like Wooden Arrows, arrows fired from an Endless Quiver are occasionally retrievable, allowing new arrows to be produced. Crafting the Endless Quiver requires 3996 Wooden Arrows.

=== Water Candle ===
Description: The Water Candle is a furniture item that can be placed or held to increase enemy and critter spawn rates in the area, and emits a low amount of light. When placed, it gives nearby players the Water Candle debuff. Holding a Water Candle does not cause the debuff icon to display, but still causes an identical effect. Several Water Candles are found commonly on the shelves of the Dungeon. They can also be crafted at a Crystal Ball, which is bought from the Wizard. The Water Candle debuff increases all enemy and critter spawn rates by 33%, and increases the maximum number of simultaneous on-screen enemies by 50%. The debuff is applied to any players holding or standing within a rectangular area of 169×125[1] () / 100×84 () tiles centered on a Water Candle. In order to be considered "holding" the candle, the player must be currently selecting it; merely being in a player's inventory or Hotbar will not suffice. Multiple candles will not stack with each other, even if one is placed and the other held. Water Candles can only be placed on platforms and flat furniture items like Work Benches and Tables. Placed Water Candles can be shut off by pressing the ⚷ Interact button on them, and will toggle when activated via wiring. Water Candles that are turned off will not activate the Water Candle debuff. Water Candles cannot be turned off, and do not act as mechanisms. The Water Candle's effect is the opposite of the Peace Candle, which decreases enemy spawn rates. If a Peace Candle and a Water Candle are active at the same time, neither have any effect on spawn rates. Conversely, the Water Candle's effect stacks with that of the Battle Potion.

Description: Daybloom Seeds are a type of seed that can be obtained from harvesting Dayblooms while they are blooming or using the Staff of Regrowth on naturally grown Dayblooms while they are fully grown. Daybloom will only bloom during daytime, showing off a sunflower-like head. Each plant will drop 1–3 Daybloom Seeds when harvested while blooming. Daybloom Seeds can be placed on pure and Hallowed grass (including Mowed grass and Mowed Hallowed grass), empty Clay Pots, or any types of Planter Boxes, and will grow into harvestable Dayblooms. They will grow anywhere, not just in direct sunlight on the Surface, but will only yield seeds when blooming.


=== Buggy ===
Description: Buggy is one of three critters that occasionally spawn in the Jungle or Underground Jungle biome when a player breaks a background plant (using any pickaxe or drill), the others being Sluggy (more common) and Grubby (most common). Buggy is the rarest of the three. It can be caught with any type of Bug Net, and used as bait with 40% Bait Power. Unsurprisingly, as Buggy is the rarest, it is the only one with a 02* rarity, while Sluggy and Grubby have 01* rarities.

=== Stardust Cell Staff ===
Description: The Stardust Cell Staff is a Hardmode, post-Lunatic Cultist summon weapon that summons a Stardust Cell (a minion version of the Star Cell enemy) that can perform a ranged attack and will teleport to enemies out of range. Like other minions, the summoned Stardust Cell is invincible and follows the player for an unlimited amount of time, unless the player dies, summons a replacement minion, cancels the buff, or leaves the world. The Stardust Cell's ranged attack consists of firing a miniature version of itself at an enemy target that it latches onto and deals damage over time to. This damage ticks 30 times before the mini-cell vanishes, and can be stacked as the Stardust Cell continues to fire additional mini-cells onto the target, able to stack for up to 100 damage per "tick". Additionally, the Stardust Cell will occasionally fire an extra shot at any target the player is attacking, without interrupting their standard rate of fire, even if the Stardust Cell is already currently attacking that target. This makes the Stardust Cell Staff very effective at attacking targets with high health. After teleporting to an enemy, a Stardust Cell will instantly fire a mini-cell. Its best modifier is Ruthless. The Mythical modifier provides the widest array of stat bonuses, but these primarily affect the initial summon rather than the resulting minion. Additionally, minions cannot deal critical hits. The only lasting advantage a Mythical Stardust Cell Staff has over a Ruthless one is knockback.

=== Reflective Gold Dye ===
Description: Reflective Gold Dye is a type of dye that is randomly given to you when you give a Strange Plant to the Dye Trader NPC. When equipped, it will give the selected accessory/armor a gold-plated, "shiny" effect, reflecting the surrounding light around the player. The reflection is more pronounced the closer the player is to a light source. The dye will prioritize light from the sun when the player is outside. From some perspectives, the player may look 3D when this dye is equipped all over. As with other reflective dyes, this dye is not animated when standing still, but the shading on a dyed piece of equipment will change according to the surrounding light, giving it the appearance of light reflecting off of a shining metallic object.


=== Wrath Potion ===
Description: The Wrath Potion is a buff potion which grants the Wrath buff when consumed. The buff increases damage done with weapons by 10%. This lasts for 4 minutes, but can be canceled at any time by right-clicking the icon ( ), by selecting the icon and canceling it in the equipment menu ( ), by double-tapping the buff icon ( ), or by canceling the buff from the buffs screen (). It appears to be the Corruption variant of the Rage Potion. This potion can only be crafted in worlds with Corruption due to it requiring the Ebonkoi, although it is possible to make an artificial Corruption biome in a Crimson world by importing either Corruption blocks, Purple Solution, or Corrupt Seeds. As of version 1.4.0.1, it is possible to naturally acquire a Wrath Potion in a Crimson world by purchasing Corrupt Seeds from the Dryad in a Hardmode Graveyard biome, and using the Corrupt Seeds to make an artificial Corruption biome to fish in.

Its alternate ore counterpart, the Mythril Pickaxe, is slightly weaker than the Orichalcum Pickaxe. It can mine any block except Chlorophyte Ore and Lihzahrd Bricks. Its best modifier is Legendary.

Description: The Wooden Crate is a pre-Hardmode crate that can be obtained by fishing in any biome, at any height. It is the lowest tier of standard crate, having the least value if sold directly. Its Hardmode counterpart is the Pearlwood Crate. While a Wooden Crate nominally offers the least valuable rewards, it is the only crate tier which drops ores. As such, it is one of the few sources for "alternate" ores on these versions. Note: Only one type of item out of the ores and bars can drop, not both a type of ore and a type of bar. The table above implies otherwise with the ores and the bars being in separate rows, but that is for readability purposes. The chance that a type of ore or bar is dropped is 25*1/4 (25%).

Description: The Ladybug is a small uncommon critter that can be found in Forests with a town during the Windy Day event (not at night). It can be caught with a Bug Net and carried in the inventory, or crafted into a Ladybug Cage. It can also be used as bait for fishing. Touching naturally spawned Ladybugs will temporarily increase the player's luck, while killing them or consuming them as bait will temporarily decrease the player's luck.

=== Plasma Lamp ===
Description: The Plasma Lamp is a mechanism item purchased from the Party Girl for 2, that emits a faint blue light and has an animated texture. It is not considered a suitable light source for an NPC house. It is used purely as a decorative light source.


=== Goblin Battle Standard ===
Description: The Goblin Battle Standard is an item that summons a Goblin Army when used. This can be useful for farming Spiky Balls or in a world where you need to obtain the Goblin Tinkerer and don't want to wait for the random Goblin Army event. It is also useful in Hardmode for farming Goblin Warlocks and the shadowflame weapons they drop. The Goblin Battle Standard is consumed when used, so one must be crafted for each invasion the player wishes to summon. The Tattered Cloth required for crafting the Goblin Battle Standard is obtained by killing Goblin Scouts which spawn occasionally in the East and West thirds of the world. In order for it to be used, at least one player must have 200 health or more.

Description: Pink Gel is a rare crafting material dropped by Pinky in stacks of 25–50.

"Bouncy" items act like their normal variants, but bounce more times and more vigorously before losing momentum. Crafting one of each item requires 18 Pink Gel, meaning that killing a single Pinky is sufficient to craft all items at least once.

=== Reindeer Bells ===
Description: The Reindeer Bells are a Hardmode, post-Plantera mount summon item. It summons the rideable Rudolph character which greatly speeds a player's movement and adds the ability to fly. It has a chance of between 0.56% and 0.83% to be dropped by the Ice Queen during or after wave 15 of the Frost Moon event. Similar to the Hoverboard, flight height can be constrained by holding the ▼ Down key in addition to the ↷ Jump key, so movement will be horizontal only.


=== Advanced Combat Techniques ===
Description: Advanced Combat Techniques is a consumable item obtained by fishing during a Blood Moon. It can only be used once per world, and others cannot be fished up once one has already been used. However, multiple copies can be obtained until the first is used. On use, it permanently increases the defense of Town NPCs by 6 and attack damage by 20%, similar to the increases after each type of boss is defeated. When used, the status message "The book's knowledge empowers your villagers!" is displayed.


=== Nightglow ===
Description: The Nightglow is a Hardmode, post-Plantera magic weapon that has a 25*1/4 (25%) chance to be dropped by the Empress of Light. When fired, four rainbow crystals emerge from the player and home in on nearby enemies. Each of the rainbow crystals can pierce enemies and hit three times, resulting in high potential damage, but loses 20% of damage for each enemy struck.[1] Its best modifier is Mythical.


=== Maggot ===
Description: Maggots are critters that replace Worms in the Graveyard mini-biome and fall off of Maggot Zombies when hit. They cannot harm players. They move and behave similarly to worms, and can be used as bait with 22% bait power. It can be caught with any Bug Net to be carried around in the inventory and released later, or crafted into a Maggot Cage to be used as decorative furniture. Once crafted, the caged Maggot cannot be released again, and when placed down it moves around inside the cage as it would do outside.

=== Rockfish ===
Description: The Rockfish is a hammer that can be fished from the underground layer but is more likely to be caught in the cavern layer, within any biome. Its hammer power is equal to that of the Molten Hamaxe. Its best modifier is Legendary. While Light may seem to provide a better speed boost by percentages, rounding reveals that Legendary and Light mine at equal speeds for this tool.


=== Kimono ===
Description: The Kimono is a Vanity item purchased from the Traveling Merchant for 1.


=== Robotic Skull ===
Description: The Robotic Skull is a pet-summoning item dropped by Skeletron Prime in Master Mode with a 25*1/4 (25%) chance. It summons Mini Prime, who follows the player around indefinitely.


=== Safe ===
Description: The Safe is a portable storage item with 40 slots to store other items. The Safe, Piggy Bank, Defender's Forge, and Void Vault have the unique ability to be carried while they contain items. It is purchased from the Merchant for 20 each, after Skeletron has been defeated. It functions identically to the Piggy Bank, except that it cannot be placed on platforms or furniture surface, and can only be placed on Blocks. The Safe does not share Piggy Bank/Chester/Money Trough's inventory space. Items in one will not appear, or take up space, in the other. The Safe (as well as the Piggy Bank, Defender's Forge, and Void Vault) functions similarly to other storage items, but with some important differences:


=== Etherian Mana ===
Description: Etherian Mana is used to summon Towers and Traps in the Old One's Army event. It has a high chance to be dropped by all of the Old One's Army event enemies. Each wave will produce Etherian Mana in multiples of ten - after receiving a starting amount of ten when activating the Eternia Crystal, each wave will produce either 20 or 30 Etherian Mana. Each Tavernkeep's sentry costs 10 Etherian Mana/Use, so conserving Etherian Mana and developing a strategy is key to the event. This item will disappear after the invasion has ended, along with all event enemies.


=== Sandgun ===
Description: The Sandgun is a ranged weapon that can use Sand, Pearlsand, Ebonsand, or Crimsand as its ammunition, which are affected by gravity. When the sand projectile hits any object, it will turn into a clump of Sand Blocks that will gather on the ground. When Pearlsand, Ebonsand, or Crimsand are used as ammo, each have the added effect of piercing through enemies. If infected sand is used as ammo, damage is increased internally by 5. However, all sand blocks have default damage value of -1, reducing Sandgun's actual damage by 1. In contrast to most non-explosive weapons, it is possible for a player firing the Sandgun to hit themselves and cause damage. Falling sand will also cause damage to any and all players. Its best modifier is Unreal. The Sandgun is incredibly strong for when it can be obtained, outperforming the Phoenix Blaster in raw damage. However, the resulting sand can impede the player. Consider using a Featherfall Potion and shooting downwards to avoid the falling sand. The Sandgun is affected by boosts that reduce ammo usage, allowing it to create more sand than what was used as ammo, which translates to "sand farming". Ammo reservation is a feature provided by two buffs and several armor sets, that lets a variety of weapons and tools have a chance to avoid consuming ammunition when they otherwise would do so. It affects not just guns, but arrows, rocket launchers, more eccentric weapons (including the Sandgun), and even tools such as the Clentaminator. For purposes of maximizing ammo reservation, start with the Ammo Box and/or Ammo Reservation Potion, each of which give 20%, stacking with each other and with armor. The earlier armor options have changed a bit in 1.4:

=== Iron Crate ===
Description: The Iron Crate is a pre-Hardmode crate that can be obtained by fishing in any biome, at any height. It is the middle tier of standard crate. Its Hardmode counterpart is the Mythril Crate. Note: Only one type of item out of the ores and bars can drop, not both a type of ore and a type of bar. The table above implies otherwise with the ores and the bars being in separate rows, but that is for readability purposes. The chance that a type of ore or bar is dropped is 37.5*3/8 (37.5%).

Critters and other passive NPCs are unaffected. This lasts for 4 minutes, but can be canceled at any time by right-clicking the icon ( ), by selecting the icon and canceling it in the equipment menu ( ), by double-tapping the buff icon ( ), or by canceling the buff from the buffs screen (). It can be crafted or found in Shadow Chests in The Underworld.

Description: Bone Throwing Knives are consumable piercing ranged weapons similar to Throwing Knives.

=== Coins ===
Description: Coins are the main unit of currency in Terraria. They are primarily used for NPC transactions, but can also be used as ammunition for the Coin Gun. Terraria's currency is made of four different metals making four types of coins: Copper Coins, Silver Coins, Gold Coins, and Platinum Coins. Coins can be obtained by killing enemies, interacting with NPCs, finding them in multiple forms of loot, or shaking trees. Despite coins appearing as the materials "Copper", "Silver", "Gold", or "Platinum", they are not related to their respective ore types and cannot be crafted from them. The coin value an enemy drops upon death is calculated from fixed values in the game code, with some random variation. See NPC drops § Coin drops for further information. Inside the player's inventory, coins have their own special slots, although it is possible to move them into normal inventory slots.

=== Explosive Trap sentry summons ===
Description: The Explosive Trap Rod, Cane, and Staff are special sentry summon weapons They can summon the Explosive Trap sentry, which lasts for 10 minutes / 2 minutes , remains stationary, and does not count against the player's minion capacity. Each Explosive Trap sentry is a small device on the ground that explodes when an enemy comes in close proximity. It does not disappear upon exploding, but remains at its summon point to explode repeatedly until its time is exhausted or the Old One's Army event ends. The Rod is sold by the Tavernkeep for 50000*5 , the Cane for 150000*15 , and Staff for 600000*60 . The Rod is always available. The Cane becomes available after defeating one Mechanical Boss, and the Staff becomes available after defeating Golem. The three different versions cause an identical effect, but with varying statistics, with the Staff being the most expensive and the most powerful. These weapons can only be used outside of the Old One's Army event after the event has been successfully completed. Completing the event on any difficulty allows Rods, Canes, and Staves alike to be used outside of the event. During the Old One's Army event, Etherian Mana can be collected, which allows the placement of multiple Explosive Traps that remain permanently until the event is over. Etherian Mana cannot be used outside the event. Explosive Trap sentries are boosted by the Huntress armor and Red Riding armor set bonuses, which cause their explosions to 'oil' enemies. Oiled enemies take 25 more damage over time from the On Fire!, Cursed Inferno, Frostburn, or Shadowflame Debuffs. However, this extra damage does not stack. Its best modifier is Demonic or Deadly, as it does not have any knockback and thus cannot get modifiers that affect it.

=== Bone Key ===
Description: The Bone Key is a pet-summoning item that is always dropped from the Dungeon Guardian. Upon use, it summons a Baby Skeletron Head pet which follows the player around infinitely. The Baby Skeletron Head floats around the player and sometimes spins its head, similarly to Skeletron's spinning head attack or the Dungeon Guardians in general. This action may also occur if the player is a bit further away from the Skeletron Head. Because Dungeon Guardians have extremely high stats intended to instantly kill all players, this can be a difficult item to acquire.


=== Seashells ===
Description: Seashells are decorative items that can be found in the Ocean biomes. They can spawn on Sand Blocks within the biome, both on the beach and underwater. When placed, they can appear as one of three variants. Seashells can appear back on beaches and underwater, as long as no more than 3 Corals or Seashells are within an 8-tile range. Spawn rates scale with Rain, Wind, and empty space up to 14 tiles above the Sand Block. When a Seashell spawns, there is a 79.4% chance for either a regular Seashell or a Starfish, 9.8% chance for a Tulip Shell, 8.8% chance for a Lightning Whelk Shell, and 2% chance for a Junonia Shell. Seashells do not respawn and are limited to the number spawned during world generation, making them a non-renewable item.

Each Living Wood Chest will always contain one primary item, and can potentially contain multiple secondary items, or none at all. Besides one of the items listed here, it will also contain common items of Surface Chests. Note: If a Living Wood Chest contains a Living Wood Wand, it will also contain a Leaf Wand, and vice versa – never only one of them.

=== Worm Tooth ===
Description: Worm Tooth is a crafting material dropped by Devourers in The Corruption. It appears to be the tooth of the Devourers. Unlike most Corruption items, it does not have a Crimson equivalent, rendering its recipes uncraftable in a Crimson world prior to Hardmode without bringing over items from a Corrupt world. However, in Hardmode, when the Dryad is in the Graveyard biome, she sells the seeds of the world evil opposite of the current world evil (i.e. Corrupt Seeds in a Crimson world and Crimson Seeds in a Corrupt world). This means the player can create an artificial Corrupt biome in a Crimson world, and therefore allow Devourers to spawn and drop Worm Teeth.

Description: The Lizard Egg is a pet-summoning item that spawns a Pet Lizard to follow the player around. It is dropped from Flying Snakes and Lihzahrds in the Jungle Temple with a chance of 0.1*1/1000 (0.1%).


=== Steampunk Goggles ===
Description: The Steampunk Goggles are a vanity item purchased from the Steampunker for 3 during the Halloween Event.


=== Crimson Rod ===
Description: The Crimson Rod is a magic weapon that launches a reddish rain cloud towards the cursor, where it rains damaging blood droplets downward onto enemies below. The cloud projectile does not pass through terrain, instead stopping if it hits a surface before it reaches its target location. As well, its coverage area is rather narrow, making it difficult to use in open areas or against agile foes. The droplets can pierce one enemy, dissipating upon hitting a second one or a solid block. They also dissipate after falling for around 20 tiles. The Crimson Rod can be obtained by destroying Crimson Hearts found in the Crimson or from Crimson Crates and Hematic Crates, which are fished in the Crimson. Its best modifier is Demonic or Deadly for damage output, or Mystic for mana conservation because it cannot get modifiers that affect knockback. Note that with the Rod's sentry-like summon pattern, mana usage is unlikely to be an issue, and that boosts to speed only affect how quickly the cloud can be resummoned, not how quickly the cloud produces rain.


=== Mechanical Ruler ===
Description: The Mechanical Ruler is an accessory purchased from the Mechanic for 1. While equipped, it draws a semi-transparent grid overlay on the screen, making individual block distances much clearer. This grid fades out when the player begins moving and returns once movement stops. The row and column of the block the mouse is hovering over are also highlighted in red, drawing a cross on the screen with the cursor at its center. On the Old-gen console version, Windows Phone version, and Nintendo 3DS version, this effect is caused by the Ruler.


=== Exploding Bullet ===
Description: Exploding Bullets are one of six types of craftable bullets made from Empty Bullets, which are sold by the Arms Dealer in Hardmode. These bullets detonate upon contact with an enemy or terrain, causing small splash damage and knockback to all enemies caught within the blast radius, even through walls. The cost of a stack of 50 Exploding Bullets is 1450, which is 29 per bullet. The cost of crafting 1000 Exploding Bullets (20 stacks of 50) is 290.

=== Buckets ===
Description: Buckets are tools used to carry water, lava, or honey, allowing them to be removed or placed. With an Empty Bucket, pressing the ⚒ Use / Attack button on any sufficient body of liquid collects it, which replaces the Empty Bucket with the respective Water Bucket, Lava Bucket, or Honey Bucket. Pressing the ⚒ Use / Attack button again will deposit the liquid at the location of the cursor, wherein the filled bucket is again replaced with an Empty Bucket. Each bucket holds one tile of liquid. The Bottomless Water Bucket, Bottomless Lava Bucket, Bottomless Honey Bucket and Bottomless Shimmer Bucket act as infinite water, lava, honey and shimmer placing buckets respectively. They also add/remove liquids at a slightly faster speed than their normal bucket counterparts (especially when moving the cursor around while filling/draining). Similarly, the Super Absorbant Sponge and Lava Absorbant Sponge and Honey Absorbant Sponge are essentially "Bottomless" Empty Buckets that accept only water, lava, or honey, respectively, but which cannot place the liquids. The Ultra Absorbant Sponge will absorb any liquid.

=== Archaeologist's set ===
Description: The Archaeologist's set is a Vanity set composed of the Archaeologist's Hat, the Archaeologist's Jacket and the Archaeologist's Pants. These items are to be equipped in the Social Slots as they only provide a visual appearance. While two of the pieces are crafted, the Archaeologist's Hat is not, but rather dropped by Doctor Bones. It is possible to craft these items in a world that has The Crimson instead of The Corruption only by creating an artificial Corruption or by simply bringing leather to the Crimson world (or using a Corrupt Statue to spawn Eater of Souls).

Description: The Snowball Launcher is a pre-Hardmode placeable weapon which unlike the Cannon or Bunny Cannon, requires no ammunition to fire. Once placed, clicking ⚒ Use / Attack on it will fire a single Snowball and holding the key will release a rapid fire of snowballs, with a spread of roughly thirty degrees. It can be dropped from the Snow Flinx in the Ice biome with a chance of 0.67*1/150 (0.67%). Similar to the Cannon, the Snowball Launcher can also be triggered by wire. Depending on the lateral position of the connected wire within the sprite of the Snowball Launcher, it will either shoot a snowball (with a cooldown of 1/6th of a second) or turn to the side the wire is on. Snowballs fired by activating the Snowball Launcher via wire are purely cosmetic, deal no damage, and are not consumed from the player's inventory.

=== Gold Shortsword ===
Description: The Gold Shortsword is the highest tier of early game metal shortswords, being stronger than the Silver Shortsword, yet slightly weaker than its alternate version, the Platinum Shortsword. Like all shortswords, the Gold Shortsword has a very limited range and attacks with a stabbing motion at any direction on PC, Console, Mobile, and tModLoader, and horizontally in front of the player on Old-gen console, Windows Phone, Old Chinese, 3DS, and tModLoader Legacy, instead of an arc. This makes it almost useless against flying or jumping enemies, although its high attack rate makes it somewhat effective against weaker fighter type enemies. Its best modifier is Legendary.

=== Slime Gun ===
Description: The Slime Gun is a novelty weapon that deals no damage. It auto-fires an arc of slime that inflicts the Slime debuff on players, enemies, and NPCs, causing them to drip blue goo for 30 seconds. This effect is purely cosmetic. The Slime Gun can be used limitlessly and does not consume any ammunition or mana. It has a 66.67*2/3 (66.67%) chance of being dropped by King Slime. The Slime Gun cannot be reforged, and therefore cannot have modifiers. It can be considered a counterpart to the Sparkle Slime Balloon.


=== Pixie Dye ===
Description: Pixie Dye is a Hardmode dye sometimes acquired from the Dye Trader after completing a Strange Plant quest. It can only be obtained after defeating Plantera. When equipped, it turns the player yellow-orange, giving the slight glow that Pixies give off.

It is one of the earliest available Chainsaws upon entering Hardmode, as is its slightly weaker alternative, the Cobalt Chainsaw. Like all Axes and Chainsaws, it is used to cut down Trees, Cacti and Giant Glowing Mushrooms. Its best modifier is Godly or Demonic.

=== Night Owl Potion ===
Description: The Night Owl Potion is a buff potion which grants the Night Owl buff when consumed. The buff improves the player's night vision, and sharply increases the radius of any available light source. This potion has no effect on total darkness. This lasts for 10 minutes / 4 minutes, but can be canceled at any time by right-clicking the icon ( ), by selecting the icon and canceling it in the equipment menu ( ), by double-tapping the buff icon ( ), or by canceling the buff from the buffs screen (). The ingredients of this potion, the Daybloom and Blinkroot, are exceedingly common and can easily be grown in Clay Pots or Planter Boxes or just farmed naturally within one's base. Combined with the Shine Potion, it is possible to see about half the screen using nothing but basic, low-level ingredients that far outshine the Shadow Orb or other mobile light sources for exploration.

=== Golden Bug Net ===
Description: The Golden Bug Net is an upgraded version of the Bug Net and Lavaproof Bug Net. It functions similarly, being a swung tool that captures critters, but is larger, faster, and can destroy any tiles that weapons can destroy (like tall grass, vines, or fully grown Pumpkins), and also allows the player to catch Underworld critters. The Golden Bug Net has a 1.25*1/80 (1.25%) chance to be rewarded for completing the fishing quests from the Angler.


=== Flinx Staff ===
Description: The Flinx Staff is a pre-Hardmode summon weapon that summons a Flinx minion. Upon hitting an enemy, it bounces off creating a small puff of blue smoke where it immediately tries to hit the enemy again. Sometimes it will not bounce far enough away from the enemy, and will deal damage two times within just a few frames. If the player gets too far away, goes behind a wall, or flies up in the air, the Flinx will twirl end over end towards the player. Like other minions, the summoned Flinx is invincible and follows the player for an unlimited amount of time, unless the player dies, summons a replacement minion, cancels the buff, or leaves the world. Visually, the minion looks like a purple-colored Snow Flinx with a bun of fur behind its head. Unlike other summon weapons, its best possible modifier is Mythical because both the Ruthless and Mythical modifiers only raise its base damage to 9 due to rounding.

=== Cobalt Chainsaw ===
Description: The Cobalt Chainsaw is a Hardmode chainsaw that is obtainable after defeating the Wall of Flesh, and is the chainsaw alternative to the Cobalt Waraxe. Although the Cobalt Waraxe and Cobalt Chainsaw have equal axe powers, the waraxe chops down trees at a faster rate (assuming no buffs/modifiers are in effect). It is one of the earliest available axe tools upon entering Hardmode, along with its slightly stronger ore alternative, the Palladium Chainsaw. Like all axes and chainsaws, it is used to cut down trees, cacti, and Giant Glowing Mushrooms. Its best modifier is Godly or Demonic.

Description: Sticky Bombs are a type of explosive crafted from Bombs and Gel. They can be used as a mining tool or a weapon, although generally the former. When used, a Sticky Bomb is thrown a few blocks away from the player and sticks to the first solid tile it touches (including a ceiling or a platform). If the tile it sticks to is removed by some means, it will fall until it hits another tile. After 3 seconds, it will explode, inflicting 100 points of damage to nearby enemies and destroying multiple blocks around it. The player can also inflict harm to themselves if not careful. Sticky Bombs can destroy almost any block (with some exceptions), which can then be collected.

=== Meteorite ===
Description: Meteorite is an uncommon type of ore mined from Meteorite crash sites. Crash sites are not generated upon world creation, but instead generate throughout the game based on certain conditions. Mining Meteorite requires a Tungsten Pickaxe, Gold Pickaxe or better. It cannot be mined with the Tungsten Pickaxe's counterpart, the Silver Pickaxe, as it lacks the required pickaxe power. Additionally, Meteor Heads also have a 2% chance to drop a single piece of Meteorite, though only in pre-Hardmode. Crash sites can occur anywhere, accompanied by a message signifying the event. Meteorite is required to craft Meteorite Bars. Contact with Meteorite blocks causes the player to be inflicted with the Burning debuff, unless the player has the Obsidian Skull accessory (or its upgrades) equipped, or is using an Obsidian Skin Potion. Meteorite can be mined without these defenses, and the ore is safe to collect once mined. Any area with at least 75 / 50 / 23 Meteorite blocks in close proximity (e.g. a natural crash site) becomes a Meteorite biome, which will spawn Meteor Heads.

Description: Poo is a type of decorative block obtained by sitting on a Toilet while any tier of Well Fed is active. The amount of Poo dropped is based on the tier of the buff, as well as its remaining duration. The Golden Delight will give 141 tiles of Poo. Poo blocks give 3 seconds of Stinky to all players that stand on it. When placed down, visual flies will continuously fade in and out around it. The quantity of flies scale with the amount of Poo blocks in one area. These flies are only visual, and cannot be caught with a bug net. Poo will negate any fall damage from any height if the player lands directly on a poo block.

Description: Wood armor is an armor set consisting of the Wood Helmet, Wood Breastplate, and Wood Greaves. It is the least powerful set of armor in the game, making it only useful very early on. It is easy to craft, as it only requires Wood to make, and the player is highly likely to spawn in a Forest, meaning the player can make this armor almost immediately after spawning. Wearing the full set grants a basic 2 / 3 defense plus a set bonus of 1 defense, which adds up to a total of 3 / 4 defense.

=== Scorpion ===
Description: Scorpions are harmless critters that can be caught with a Bug Net and do not normally interact with the player in any other way, except in that they can be killed by both players and enemies. They have 5 health and usually serve as ambient entities in Terraria. Scorpions only spawn in the Desert during the Day. Its counterpart is the Black Scorpion. Most naturally spawned Scorpions can be caught with a Bug Net, and carried in the player's inventory (or placed in storage). If a critter caught with any Bug Net is taken from inventory and "used" (placed), it is again released into the environment at the cursor and behaves as usual. On PC, Console, Mobile, Old Chinese, tModLoader, and tModLoader Legacy, Scorpions can be sold to any NPC vendor. All caught Scorpions can be crafted into Scorpion Cages to create animated display furniture. Once crafted, the critter cannot be released. A Scorpion Cage occupies a 6x3 space. It displays an animated Scorpion inside. On PC, Console, Mobile, tModLoader, and tModLoader Legacy, Critters spawned from statues cannot be caught with the Bug Net; attempting to do so will cause the critter to disappear in a puff of smoke. A Scorpion can be used for fishing, with a bait power of 10%.

Description: The Eye of Cthulhu is a Hardmode, post-Plantera yoyo which has a 33.33*1/3 (33.33%) / 55.56*5/9 (55.56%) chance to drop from Mothron during a Solar Eclipse. It is one of the few yoyos that can stay in the air indefinitely, and it has a reach of 23 tiles. It is currently the second strongest yoyo in the game, only beaten by the Terrarian. Its best modifier is Godly or Demonic. Both modifiers increase the average damage output by the same amount.


=== Candy Corn Rifle ===
Description: The Candy Corn Rifle is a Hardmode post-Plantera gun that auto-fires Candy Corn as ammunition. It is dropped rarely (1.79–14.29% chance) by the Pumpking during the Pumpkin Moon event. Candy Corn drops along with the weapon, and can be purchased from the Arms Dealer when a Candy Corn Rifle is in the player's inventory. Candy Corn shots pierce up to two enemies and ricochet up to four times, dissipating on their fifth impact or third enemy hit. The gun has a high fire rate, but unlike most guns, its projectiles are affected by gravity and do not remain airborne for long, though their ricochet ability helps them gain distance. The Candy Corn Rifle has a base 10% critical strike chance as opposed to the usual 4%. Its best modifier is Unreal.


=== Flurry Boots ===
Description: Flurry Boots are an accessory that can be found in Frozen Chests in the underground Snow Biome, as well as Frozen and Boreal Crates. When equipped, they allow the player to gain a speed boost after running for a certain distance continuously. Your speed will continue increasing until maximum speed is attained. At full sprint, they will increase your horizontal movement speed by about 40%. (See Sprinting accessories for more information on the sprint effect.) The Flurry Boots, Hermes Boots, Dunerider Boots and the Sailfish Boots have identical functionality, with their only differences being aesthetic (and being faster on Sand Blocks, in the case of the Dunerider Boots). In the case of the Flurry Boots, the user will leave a short dust trail under themselves as they run, which disappears immediately upon stopping, unlike the Hermes Boots. All four listed boots are interchangeable when crafting Spectre Boots.

=== Announcement Box ===
Description: The Announcement Box is a special sign that, when powered, will announce (in the chat) what was written on the sign. Certain keywords will change the formatting of the text, for example color. Everything written here can also be applied in a normal chat with the same effect. To change the color of inputted text, type [c/XXXXXX:] with text after the colon and any hexadecimal ("hex" for short) color code in place of "XXXXXX". This is an incomplete list of the colors used by the game: One can achieve a color shift/gradient by using many [c/XXXXXX:] back to back. It is possible to showcase an item in chat using Item IDs, similar to how Alt+Click works in normal chat. To show an item type [i/zXX:ID] , where "zXX" is a property of an item, and "ID" is an ID of an item". All items in chat occupy the same height and width. Coupled with the fact that there can only be 10 lines of text in the chat at one time means that one can in theory create a rudimentary animation using mechanisms. Walls are very good for this purpose as they are big squares. Be aware that by doing animations, the messages are spamming the chat which can lead to the annoyance of other players as they can not communicate via chat. It can also make one miss status messages. Valid item properties are (XX — a number): The easiest way of getting an Item code is doing the following: first open the chat, Alt+Click needed item, press Ctrl+A to select all text in the chat, press Ctrl+C to copy it, and finally paste the code into Announcement Box. It is also possible to write a link to achievement into chat, for this type[a:NAME] , with "NAME" being an Achievement name. Controller buttons can be displayed using the [g:#] tag, where # corresponds to one of the following functions: [g:16][g:16][g:15][g:15][g:14][g:13][g:14][g:13][g:1][g:0][g:5] Note that this outputs literal button glyphs, and the output may not match functions assigned in the player's current control scheme. While minor, this could limit the usefulness in custom world designs.

Holding the Football and pressing ⚒ Use / Attack throws the Football. It can then be "caught" and picked up again, even while in flight, by another player, or by the same player. A player who takes any damage while a Football is anywhere in their inventory will automatically drop the Football, and it can again be picked up by another player, or by the same player. If multiple Footballs are in the player's inventory at the time, they all drop.

Description: Fireblossom is a type of herb which appears as a small, magma-colored flower. It grows on Ash Blocks in The Underworld and can be cut with virtually any weapon or tool. It can also be planted in Clay Pots, Planter Boxes, or on Ash Blocks using Fireblossom Seeds. Fireblossoms will bloom when the sun is setting, from 3:45 pm to 7:30 pm, unless it is raining. Both the Fireblossom and its respective seeds have a chance to be obtained from the Herb Bag. Like the Fireblossom Seeds, this item is immune to lava despite being white rarity. Fireblossoms require that they are at least partially submerged in lava to bloom, but will bloom any time of day once they are submerged.

=== Slime Staff ===
Description: The Slime Staff is a pre-Hardmode summon weapon that summons a Baby Slime minion. Baby Slimes attack by bouncing on the ground and chasing enemies, rapidly dealing contact damage. Like other minions, the summoned Baby Slime is invincible and follows the player for an unlimited amount of time, unless the player dies, summons a replacement minion, cancels the buff, or leaves the world. The Slime Staff generally has the rarest drop chance of any weapon, with minor exceptions. The typical drop rate from most slimes and Slimed Zombies is 0.01*1/10000 (0.01%) / 0.0143*1/7000 (0.0143%). Pinky has a greatly increased drop rate of 1*1/100 (1%) / 1.4286*1/70 (1.4286%). Additionally, Sand Slimes have a drop rate of 0.0125*1/8000 (0.0125%) / 0.0179*1/5600 (0.0179%). The slimes which cannot drop the Slime Staff are: Lava, Dungeon, Umbrella, Hoppin' Jack, Corrupt (Shadow), King Slime, Queen Slime, Crimslime, Gastropod (Spectral), Rainbow. Unlike other summon weapons, its best possible modifier is Mythical because both the Ruthless and Mythical modifiers only raise its base damage to 9 due to rounding.

=== Desert Tiger Staff ===
Description: The Desert Tiger Staff is a Hardmode, post-Plantera summon weapon. It summons a Desert Tiger that deals contact damage to enemies. Every six seconds,[1] the tiger can curl up and perform a pounce attack at nearby enemies, dealing 61 damage (1.5× the base damage),[2] and passing through blocks to reach them. Additionally, it can deal critical hits with this attack. The Desert Tiger Staff can always be found inside the Dungeon's Desert Chest, which can only be unlocked by a Desert Key after Plantera has been defeated. The Desert Tiger Staff is special in that if used more than once, multiple tigers do not spawn – instead, the spawned tiger becomes stronger ( +16/+17 damage; 40% of the base damage[2]) and faster for each additional summon. The tiger will appear as a baby if summoned 1 to 3 times, an adult if summoned 4 to 6 times, and an armored adult if summoned 7 or more times. Other minions may be used in addition to the Desert Tiger. Its best modifier is Ruthless. The Mythical modifier provides the widest array of stat bonuses, but these primarily affect the initial summon rather than the resulting minion. Additionally, minions cannot deal critical hits. The only lasting advantage a Mythical Desert Tiger Staff has over a Ruthless one is knockback. Note that the minion does deal critical hits when pouncing, though this attack is performed rather infrequently, in comparison.


=== Thunder Zapper ===
Description: The Thunder Zapper is a Desert-themed magic weapon obtainable in pre-Hardmode. It is found in Sandstone Chests in the Underground Desert or in Oasis Crates obtained from fishing in the Oasis. When cast, it launches a fast-moving, non-piercing projectile that is unaffected by gravity and will disappear with a visual explosion that does no damage after traveling for about one second or when hitting a solid block. The projectile moves up and down in a randomized zig-zag pattern horizontally, but not vertically (traveling straight when shooting directly up or down). Its best modifier is Mythical.


=== Ebonwood armor ===
Description: Ebonwood armor is an armor set consisting of a Ebonwood Helmet, Ebonwood Breastplate, and Ebonwood Greaves. It is crafted solely from Ebonwood harvested from Corrupt Trees. It acts as the Corruption counterpart to the Crimson's Shadewood armor, which shares same stats. Along with its counterpart, it is the most powerful Pre-Hardmode wooden set, though it still pales in comparison to most other armor sets. Wearing a full set grants a set bonus of 1 additional defense, providing a total of 5 defense.

=== Book of Skulls ===
Description: The Book of Skulls is a magic weapon that fires slow flaming skull projectiles. Each skull can pierce twice, dissipating on its third enemy impact. The skulls do not ricochet, and disappear upon colliding with objects, but they have a fairly strong homing ability on the PC version, Console version, Mobile version, and tModLoader version. They also emit a fair amount of light. The Book of Skulls has a 10.5*36/343 (10.5%) / 33.33*1/3 (33.33%) chance to drop from Skeletron. A Shadowflame variant of the Book of Skulls is used by the Clothier NPC to protect himself on the PC version, Console version, Mobile version, Old Chinese version, tModLoader version, and tModLoader 1.3-Legacy version. Its best modifier is Mythical.


=== Tablet Fragment ===
Description: The Tablet Fragment is a pet summon item with a 25*1/4 (25%) chance to drop from the Lunatic Cultist in Master Mode. It summons a Phantasmal Dragon pet that follows the player. It resembles the Phantasm Dragon spawned during the Lunatic Cultist boss fight. The only difference between the two is that the pet itself is smaller.


=== Vulcan Repeater ===
Description: The Vulcan Repeater is a post-Ocram Hardmode repeater. All arrows fired by this bow are converted to special Vulcan Bolt, which explode on impact, dealing damage to nearby enemies (and the player). Along with the other items crafted with Souls of Blight, it is strong in terms of raw power, but is out-shined by weapons with more unique effects. Its best modifier is Unreal.

However, when right-clicking, it begins to swing around in front of the player subtly, randomly shooting 3 projectiles which, after traveling a certain distance or coming into contact with any solid block or enemy, burst into damaging rings of electricity. Its best modifier is Godly or Demonic. Both modifiers increase the average damage output by the same amount.

=== Cactus ===
Description: Cactus is a crafting material obtained by harvesting Cactus plants, using an axe, chainsaw, or hamaxe just like with trees. In addition to crafting, Cactus can be used as a building material. It takes 258 items of Cactus to craft all items. The cactus plant grows in Desert biomes on all types of Sand. Cactus plants can naturally grow up to ten blocks high. Cactus plants can be harvested using an axe or chainsaw, which causes Cactus items to drop. On the Old-gen console version, Windows Phone version, Old Chinese version, Nintendo 3DS version, and tModLoader 1.3-Legacy version, mining or hammering the Sand Block the cactus plant grows on will harvest the cactus, while on the PC version, Console version, Mobile version, and tModLoader version the Sand Block the cactus plant grows on is unbreakable and not affected by gravity. Putting a sand block up to one of the stems, right under it, and then cutting the main cactus body, will make the branch a new cactus. Corruption, Crimson, and Hallow cacti will all drop the same Cactus items when harvested. Cacti will sometimes grow Pink Prickly Pears on their tops. Cactus plants cannot be planted and will only grow on a target Sand Block under the following conditions:[1] Cacti that are spawned after world generation will first always consist of a single stub and slowly extend over time.

=== Trap Door ===
Description: Trap Doors are furniture items. They are essentially full-block horizontal Doors. Trap Doors can be opened using ⚷ Interact, causing them to expand into a 2x2 block. They are valid for use in housing. Trap Doors open upward if the character opening it is below the Trap Door's level, and downward if above. The reference point for character altitude seems to be the character's center, not the feet: the character's feet can be about one half tile below the bottom of a closed Trap Door (standing on a stair), and the door will still open downward. Trap Doors can be blocked by furniture and will then always open on the free side, regardless of character position. If a Trap Door is blocked on both sides, it will not open. An open Trap Door is too narrow to be used at the end of a ramp or stairway so that a character can climb through it without jumping, as it needs to be surrounded by solid blocks, not platforms or other Trap Doors. Like normal doors, Trap Doors can be wired to be opened and closed remotely. Unlike normal doors, Trap Doors cannot be opened by Zombies during a Blood Moon event and can be useful for early players in defending their base.

=== Brain of Confusion ===
Description: The Brain of Confusion is an Expert Mode accessory item obtained from the Treasure Bag dropped by the Brain of Cthulhu. Upon taking damage with the Brain of Confusion equipped, nearby enemies have a 60*3/5 (60%) chance of receiving the Confused debuff for at minimum 1.5 seconds. The chance, duration, and area of effect of the debuff are based on the amount of damage taken. In the PC version, Console version, Mobile version, and tModLoader version, the player wielding it has a 16.67*1/6 (16.67%) chance of dodging an attack, which inflicts the Cerebral Mindtrick debuff on them for four seconds. It increases critical strike chance by 10% / 20%, despite being a debuff. While the debuff is active, the player cannot dodge another attack. Though not listed, the debuff will also increase summon damage by 10% / 20%. The base chance to inflict the Confused debuff is 60*3/5 (60%). It is increased by 0.4*1/250 (0.4%) per point of damage taken, hence with 100 or more damage taken, the debuff is guaranteed to be inflicted.[1] The debuff duration is determined randomly, and the bounds depend on the amount of damage taken:[1] The values are in seconds. The range within which enemies are affected is determined randomly as well. There are certain damage thresholds that affect which equation to use:[1] The values are in pixels; divide by 16 to obtain tiles. Examples:

=== Thin Ice ===
Description: Thin Ice is a type of block found in the Snow and Ice biomes. It is found naturally in two configurations: either a single layer over a pool of water, or in large packed regions underground. Similar to Ice Blocks, Thin Ice has reduced friction, and players will slide across it. Thin Ice will break if a player falls on it at a certain speed, usually achieved by falling normally onto it. Landing on Thin Ice will not cause fall damage itself, but it will not slow the player's fall on contact, and fall damage will continue to accumulate until the player lands on another block type (unlike Cobwebs, for instance, which reset fall damage). Ice Skates or any of the combined accessories that use them as an ingredient can be used to land on Thin Ice without breaking it and dropping through (also potentially taking fall damage, however). Thin Ice is destroyed permanently when broken, dropping nothing. On the Old-gen console version, Windows Phone version, Old Chinese version, Nintendo 3DS version, and tModLoader 1.3-Legacy version, Thin Ice cannot be picked up, crafted, or moved in any way.

=== Golf Cup ===
Description: The Golf Cup is a block and activation mechanism used in Golf. It can be purchased from the Golfer for 1. When a Golf Ball enters the cup, the golf ball projectile is removed from the world, the cup emits a wire signal, and an announcement (in the chat) will share how many strokes the player took between placing the ball, hitting it and reaching the cup.


=== Truffle Worm ===
Description: The Truffle Worm is a rare critter that spawns in the underground Glowing Mushroom biome during Hardmode. It is solely used to summon the Duke Fishron boss. In order to use it, it must be caught (e.g. with a Bug Net) and used as bait with a fishing pole in an Ocean biome. It only spawns in the Cavern layer and below, so it will not appear in surface Glowing Mushroom biomes. If the Truffle worm is caught in water it will be named "Thirsty Worm". If it is stacked with other Truffle Worms, its name will return to normal. The Truffle Worm is more difficult to catch than other critters, due to it burrowing itself making it a hasty run. Unlike most critters, the Truffle Worm cannot be used for ordinary fishing, as it is used to spawn Duke Fishron. When attempting to use it as bait, the bobber will simply sit in the water indefinitely, unless fishing in an Ocean. The Truffle Worm will always be consumed upon summoning Duke Fishron. Items that reduce the chance of bait consumption such as the Tackle Box will have no effect. On the Old Chinese version and tModLoader 1.3-Legacy version, Truffle Worms can be killed by enemies. It is one of the few entities that can be detected by the Lifeform Analyzer or its upgrades. The Bestiary entry for the Truffle Worm: "An extremely rare, difficult to catch glowworm. A specific, powerful sea creature is insatiably attracted to these."

Compared to its alternate ore version, the Iron Pickaxe, it has more pickaxe power, deals 1 more damage, and is slightly faster in terms of mining speed. Like other low-tier pickaxes, it can only mine blocks and ores weaker than Meteorite (which requires a pickaxe with at least 50% pickaxe power, e.g. a Tungsten Pickaxe). Its best modifier is Light for harvesting purposes and Legendary for combat purposes.

=== Titanium armor ===
Description: The Titanium armor set is an armor set crafted from Titanium Bars, and is the alternative to Adamantite armor. Like many Hardmode armors, it has three different headgear/helmet options, allowing the player to focus on magical, melee, or ranged combat. Crafting a one-helmet set requires 59 Titanium Bars, made from 236 / 295 Titanium Ore. Crafting all five pieces requires 85 Titanium Bars or 340 / 425 Titanium Ore. When the full set is equipped, striking an enemy with a melee, ranged, or magic weapon, or having an enemy be hit by a minion or sentry, will grant the Titanium Barrier buff, in which titanium shards spawn that will rotate around the player and damage enemies who come in contact with them. There can be a total of 7 shards spinning around the player, each dealing over 50 damage with high knockback, incapable of achieving critical strikes, and lasting 10 seconds, refreshing when the player deals damage. When the full set is equipped, striking an enemy with a melee, ranged, or magic weapon, or having an enemy be hit by a minion or sentry, will grant the Shadow Dodge buff, which allows the player to dodge the next attack dealt by an enemy. It has a cooldown of 30 / 20 seconds.

=== Glowing Snail ===
Description: The Glowing Snail is an uncommon critter that only spawns in Glowing Mushroom biomes. It can be caught using the Bug Net, carried around in the inventory and released later, or crafted into a Glowing Snail Cage, which can be placed as a furniture item. The snail also gives off a small amount of blue light, and cannot be released once crafted. Along with its uncommon chance to spawn, it often spawns together with or near enemies, causing it to be killed rather easily by them or by accident by the player. Similar to Truffle Worm, presence of Town NPCs decreases its spawn rate. It is also quite large compared to the normal cave dwelling counterpart, looking like an enemy rather than a critter. Glowing Snails can be used as bait for fishing, having 15% bait power. A Glowing Snail cage occupies a 3×2 space. The Glowing Snail inside may follow the following patterns randomly:

Description: The Familiar set is a set of vanity items that displays the player's default clothes. It consists of the Familiar Wig, the Familiar Shirt, and the Familiar Pants, and can be purchased from the Clothier for 3 (set). When a piece of the Familiar set is equipped in the vanity armor slot, it will disable the graphics of any item worn in the corresponding armor slot. As such, the Familiar Wig will show the character's hairstyle whereas the Familiar Shirt and Familiar Pants will show the character's default shirt and pants, respectively. Like all vanity items, the Familiar set does not provide anything but a change in appearance.

=== Hermes Boots ===
Description: Hermes Boots are an accessory that can be found in Chests in the Underground and Cavern layers. When equipped, they allow the player to gain a movement speed boost after running for a certain distance continuously. The speed will continue increasing until maximum speed is attained. At full sprint, they will increase the player's horizontal movement speed by about 40%. However, if the player runs into a wall without autojumping, the player will stop and have to speed up again. (See Sprinting accessories for more information on the sprint effect). The Hermes Boots, Dunerider Boots, Flurry Boots and the Sailfish Boots have near identical functionality, with their only differences being aesthetic and use. In the case of the Hermes Boots, the user will leave a lasting trail of small dust clouds as they run, which persists for a few seconds. The Dunerider Boots function similarly, the only difference being that they allow the player to run faster on sand. All four listed boots are interchangeable when crafting Spectre Boots.

=== Chest Lock ===
Description: The Chest Lock is a consumable item. Pressing the ⚒ Use / Attack button on certain types of Chests when holding it will turn the Chest into a locked Chest and consume the Chest Lock. The content of the Chest will not be affected by the conversion. Chests locked in this way work the same as the naturally generated locked Chests, requiring another respective key to unlock. Also, Do not use the Chest lock on Dressers, doing this will consume the Chest lock without locking the dresser.

=== Adamantite Ore ===
Description: Adamantite Ore is one of the two top-tier ores that can spawn from every third destroyed Altar in Hardmode (the other possible ore being Titanium). In worlds where it spawns, it is the rarest and most valuable of the three Altar-spawned ores. A Mythril/Orichalcum Drill, Mythril/Orichalcum Pickaxe, or better is required in order to mine Adamantite. An Adamantite Forge, crafted from 30 Adamantite Ore and one Hellforge, is required in order to craft Adamantite Bars. Adamantite Ore, as well as Adamantite Bars, can also be obtained by opening crates, eliminating the need for a higher-tier pickaxe. Adamantite Ore is also dropped by Ocram. Crafting all Adamantite items requires 174 Adamantite Bars, plus 30 raw ore for an Adamantite Forge, for a total of 696 / 900 Adamantite Ore.

=== Crystal Storm ===
Description: The Crystal Storm is a Hardmode / pre-Hardmode magic weapon that quickly fires a slightly spread flood of tiny, bouncing crystals. The crystals are not affected by gravity, and last about three seconds each, losing velocity until gradually dissipating in midair. Their speed or fade at impact does not affect their damage output. The crystals also provide a small amount of purple light. The Crystal Storm may be obtained prior to Hardmode as a rare drop from Arch Demons (0.2*1/500 (0.2%)). The Crystal Storm is the Hallowed counterpart to the Corruption's Cursed Flames, or the Crimson's Golden Shower. On the PC, Console, Mobile, and tModLoader, its best modifier is Mythical. On the Old-gen console, Windows Phone, Old Chinese, 3DS, and tModLoader Legacy, its best modifier is either Masterful for mana conservation or Godly/Demonic for higher damage output. It cannot get the Mythical modifier due to its low mana cost.

The Lavaproof Tackle Bag's increase in fishing power stacks with that of the Angler Earring and the Angler Tackle Bag, granting a total boost of 30% if all three are equipped. The decreased chance to consume bait does not stack with that of the Tackle Box or the Angler Tackle Bag.

=== Fallen Star ===
Description: Fallen Stars are items that randomly fall from the sky at night, from 7:30 PM until dawn (4:30 AM), and will enter the player's inventory when the player is in range. Any Fallen Star that has not been collected will disappear at dawn. They can be used to craft Mana Crystals, which permanently increase a player's mana capacity by 20 points each. They are also used in a variety of crafting recipes, and as ammunition for the Star Cannon and Super Star Shooter. Hence, Fallen Stars can be stored in ammo slots. Fallen Stars will not fall if time freeze is activated while playing on journey mode. For each game tick[1], the chance of a Fallen Star spawning is 21/16,800 (0.125%) in small worlds, 32/16,800 (≈0.1905%) in medium worlds, and 42/16,800 (0.25%) in large worlds.[2] Therefore, the average number of Fallen Stars per night is 40.5 in a small world, about 61.71 in a medium world, and 81 in a large world. Fallen Stars spawn anywhere within the upper 5% of the world, i.e. 60 tiles in small worlds, 90 tiles in medium worlds, and 120 tiles in large worlds. Meteor showers increase this rate. Fallen Stars emit light while on the ground, making them easy to spot at night. They cannot be placed by the player as permanent light sources, but can be combined with a Bottle to craft the Star in a Bottle. They will disappear if dropped by a player during the day, but can remain in a player's inventory or a storage object (such as a chest) indefinitely. Although uncommon, Fallen Stars can hit enemies and bosses for 1000 damage[3]. They cannot damage players (on the Everything Seed, Fallen Stars insta-kill the player).

=== Boreal Wood Sword ===
Description: The Boreal Wood Sword is a broadsword crafted from Boreal Wood. It is similar to the Wooden Sword, but it deals 1 more damage and 1 more knockback, and has a lower use time. Because Snow biomes are usually not too far from the initial spawn point, a Boreal Wood Sword can be a superior alternative to its standard counterpart. The Boreal Wood Sword's damage is equivalent to that of a Copper Broadsword, though it would be wise to craft this instead due to how cheap it is to obtain. Its best modifier is Legendary.

They require Luminite and Lunar Fragments to craft, obtainable from the Moon Lord and Celestial Towers, respectively. They have the highest hammer power in the game, along with The Axe. They are beaten only by The Axe in axe power, making them the second-strongest axes. Their best modifier is Legendary. While Light may seem to provide a better speed boost by percentages, rounding reveals that Legendary and Light mine at equal speeds for these tools.

=== Ice Bow ===
Description: The Ice Bow is a Hardmode bow that has a 31.67*19/60 (31.67%) chance to be dropped by Ice Mimics in the Ice biome. On the PC version, Console version, Mobile version, and tModLoader version, it is capable of autofire. When fired, the next available arrow will instead be converted into a special Frost Arrow which fires at a higher velocity than average arrows. However, while the used arrow's base damage is accounted for, special properties of converted arrows are entirely lost. Unlike the craftable Frostburn Arrows, these special Frost Arrows do not inflict the Frostburn debuff. Its best modifier is Unreal. The Ice Bow receives a plethora of changes in the "remix" seed, swapping it with the Snowball Cannon in progression. As such, in the seed, the Ice Bow is heavily nerfed for use in early Pre-Hardmode, and is found inside of Ice Chests in place of the Snowball Cannon.


=== Dryad set ===
Description: The Dryad set is a vanity set which is purchased from the Dryad for 3 each, during Halloween. It resembles the clothing that the Dryad wears regularly.


=== Ebonstone Wall ===
Description: Ebonstone Walls are naturally-occurring background walls found in the Corruption chasms. They can be destroyed with the Hammer. In Old-gen console version, Windows Phone version, Old Chinese version, Nintendo 3DS version, and tModLoader 1.3-Legacy version, Ebonstone Walls cannot be crafted by the player, but they can be converted from Stone Walls by using Purple Solution sprayed with the Clentaminator. As the Clentaminator affects a rather large area, creating areas of localized Ebonstone Walls without converting blocks and other wall parts may be difficult. They are not suitable for NPC housing and cannot be picked up when destroyed with a Hammer. In PC version, Console version, Mobile version, and tModLoader version, Ebonstone Walls can be crafted from Ebonstone Blocks at a Work Bench with Ecto Mist. These walls, when placed by the player, can be picked up when destroyed by a Hammer. Player-placed Ebonstone Walls are suitable for NPC housing as well. Ebonstone Walls can spread The Corruption to nearby pure walls. See Biome spread for further information.

=== High Velocity Bullet ===
Description: High Velocity Bullets are a type of ammunition obtainable after at least one mechanical boss has been defeated. They are the fastest traveling bullets in the game, traveling at the same speed as bullets fired from the Sniper Rifle. They are one of six types of craftable bullets made from Empty Bullets, which are sold by the Arms Dealer after Hardmode has been enabled. On the PC version, Console version, Mobile version, and tModLoader version, they will pierce up to two enemies, coming to a stop when hitting the third. However, the second target will only take 85% of the base damage, and the third target will only take 85% of that (i.e. 72.25% of base). The cost of a stack of 50 High Velocity Bullets is 950, which is 19 per bullet. The cost of crafting 1000 High Velocity Bullets (20 stacks of 50) is 190.

When an enemy comes within 25 tiles and has a clear line of sight to the flame, it will home in on that enemy.[1] Upon impact with any enemy or block, it will cause a small explosion, dealing splash damage. The Spirit Flame can be used repeatedly to summon multiple flames. The flames dissipate if no target is acquired within three seconds of casting. Its best modifier is Mythical.

Description: The Ammo Box is a furniture item that, when placed and pressed ⚷ Interact on, applies the Ammo Box buff to all ranged weapons until player death. It is a Hardmode item on PC, Console, Mobile, and tModLoader, but can be obtained pre-Hardmode on Old-gen console, Windows Phone, Old Chinese, and tModLoader Legacy. It can be purchased: The Ammo Box buff provides a 20% chance per shot of a ranged weapon not consuming ammunition. As of 1.4.4, the buff lasts until the player dies or exits the game instead of only lasting for 10 minutes. It can be activated limitlessly with no cooldown period. The Ammo Box is never consumed, and all players may use it to give themselves the buff. Unlike equipment buff items, the Ammo Box must be placed in order to activate the buff. It can be mined with a pickaxe or drill and picked up again, even while the buff is active, which will not cancel the buff. Placement is only dependent on an adequate flat space of two horizontal tiles being available.

It has a Crimtane counterpart, the Blood Lust Cluster, which is stronger but also slightly slower. Like all axes, it is used to cut down Trees, Cacti and Giant Glowing Mushrooms. Despite having a higher base damage and autoswing, its slow speed means that the maximum damage output is similar to manual-swing swords such as the Gold and Platinum Broadsword, and especially less than the Light's Bane. Its best modifier is Light for harvesting purposes and Legendary for combat purposes.

=== Ducks ===
Description: Ducks and Mallard Ducks are critters. As all other critters, they have 5 health, no defense, and are often killed instantly by other enemies or the player. They can usually only spawn in the middle third of the above-ground world, or in areas near an NPC house if water is present. They only appear in pools of water, regardless of their size or if they are naturally generated. They quite frequently make a "quack" sound when nearby. Ducks will passively wander the surface until they fall a certain distance or are submerged, at which point they will switch to their alternate flying form, where they will fly in a given direction for a certain amount of time before landing and switching back to their passive form. Despite their spawn conditions, they do not prioritize water whenever landing. Ducks can be caught using a Bug Net. They can be carried around in the inventory until placed (released), deleted, or crafted into a Duck/Mallard Duck Cage. Caged Ducks can be used as furniture and cannot be released once crafted. The Duck Cage occupies a 6×3 space. The Duck inside may follow the following patterns randomly:

=== Boulder ===
Description: Boulders are unique placeable 2×2 foreground objects, and are stationary when placed. When unsupported, they fall and begin to roll away. They pick up speed and damage players, enemies and NPCs along their path. Boulders will also begin to roll if mined with a pickaxe or drill, meaning that they cannot be picked up again once placed. Boulders will roll across flat surfaces and down slopes, but will break and disappear on contact with an obstacle. They deal 120–160 / 240–320 / 360–480 damage to players (60–80 damage to NPCs, enemies, and critters) on contact.[1] Boulders pierce through an unlimited number of entities.

It moves in accordance with the direction keys the player is pressing. The Wisps' movement range appears to be about 7 tiles to the left, right, and below the player's hitbox and 7 tiles above the Wisp's normal starting position.

Note: Only one type of ore and one type of bar can drop, not both a pre-Hardmode type of ore and a Hardmode type of ore, or both a pre-Hardmode type of bar and a Hardmode type of bar. The table above implies otherwise with the respective groups being in separate rows, but that is for readability purposes. The chance that a type of ore is dropped is 14.29*1/7 (14.29%), and the chance that a type of bar is dropped is 25*1/4 (25%).

=== Heart Lantern ===
Description: The Heart Lantern is a unique variant of lantern, a hanging furniture item, that emits moderate light while also providing the Heart Lamp health regeneration buff. It must be hung from the underside of blocks, like other lanterns. The Heart Lantern is also a mechanism that can be toggled if wired. Toggling it off will only deactivate the light source, not the buff. The Heart Lamp buff provides nearby players with a constant 1 health-per-second. The buff applies to any players standing within a rectangular area of 169×125[1] () / 100×84 () tiles centered on the Heart Lantern, providing a boost in health regeneration similar to the one granted by Campfires. The regeneration buffs from both items will stack together to provide a greater regeneration boost, and being within range of these items can also help to counteract the effects of damaging debuffs (such as Poisoned and On Fire!).

=== Portal Gun Station ===
Description: The Portal Gun Station is a furniture item that can fire portals, similar to the Portal Gun, but as a stationary furniture item. It is purchased from the Cyborg for 10, if the player has a Portal Gun in their inventory. Right-click (⚷ Interact) the top of the Station to toggle orange/blue portal colors, or at the base to fire a portal. Right-click (⚷ Interact) the left or right side of the Station to rotate its shooting direction. The Station can also act as a mechanism if connected by wires to a triggering mechanism, such as a Switch or Lever. A wire connected to the top of the Station toggles its portal color, the bottom fires a portal, and the left or right rotates the firing direction. In multiplayer, if the source of activation is not directly a player, then the station will not fire nor swap colors, though any signal can rotate the station. For example, flipping a switch that fires a dart trap at a Teal Pressure Pad connected to the Station will not result in the Station firing, as it can't find a player to bind its portals to. Note that other, player-based activators like arrows or minions will cause the Teal Pressure Pad to activate the station. Timers and Sensors also cannot fire the station. Only one orange and one blue portal can exist at a time for each player, whether created by the Portal Gun or the Portal Gun Station.


=== Goldfish ===
Description: Goldfish are Critters that swim in water, and walk on land during Rain. They can be caught with the Bug Net and used to craft several items. They can be spawned from the Fish Statue. During a Blood Moon, or when hit with Vile Powder or Vicious Powder, Goldfish turn into Corrupt Goldfish or Vicious Goldfish, which have much more health and do attack players. This can be confusing for new or inexperienced players, as Goldfish are seen as passive. The Bestiary entry for the Goldfish: "A seemingly ordinary goldfish, until it decides to rain."

=== Optic Staff ===
Description: The Optic Staff is a Hardmode summon weapon that summons a miniature version of The Twins in their second form, which follow the player and attack enemies. The summoned pair of minions, named Spazmamini and Retinamini, deal damage with a ramming attack and ranged laser attack, respectively. Like other minions, the summoned Twins are invincible and follow the player for an unlimited amount of time, unless the player dies, summons a replacement minion, cancels the buff, or leaves the world. Its best modifier is Ruthless. The Mythical modifier provides the widest array of stat bonuses, but these primarily affect the initial summon rather than the resulting minion. Additionally, minions cannot deal critical hits. The only lasting advantage a Mythical Optic Staff has over a Ruthless one is knockback.

=== Teleporter ===
Description: The Teleporter is a travel mechanism from the Mechanic / the Steampunker for 250. When two Teleporters are wired together with a triggering mechanism, they can exchange players, NPCs, and most enemies between them. Teleporting is always instantaneous, has no load time or cooldown, no Mana or coin cost, and no limit on distance. Unlike most furniture, Teleporters are foreground objects. They consist of three inseparable blocks which, like all block types, can individually be shaped with a hammer or actuated. The two Teleporters to be transported between must be placed on a surface of solid blocks or platforms and connected by Wire, along with a trigger mechanism, such as a Switch or Pressure Plate. When the trigger is activated, all players, all NPCs, and most enemies touching the 3×3-tile area above it are instantly transported to the other Teleporter. A character standing a maximum of three tile heights above the Teleporter can still be transported, and burying a Teleporter two tiles deep can still transport players walking on the surface. Similarly, placing an actuated, flattened (hammered to half-height) Teleporter on platforms and standing one tile below the platforms will also transport the player. Entities retain their location relative to the Teleporter within the 3×3 area when teleporting. For instance, players using a Teleporter two tiles above its surface will arrive two tiles above the surface of the destination Teleporter. See the gallery below for example images. Teleporting is always two-way: when a connection is activated, both ends will exchange all players, NPCs, and enemies that are at least partially occupying any square of the 3×3-tile rectangle. Players should keep this in mind when constructing Teleporter paths, as enemies could unintentionally be brought into a base, for example. When a wire network (single color) with more than two Teleporters is activated, an algorithm determines which pair will activate. This algorithm was rather naive prior to the 1.2.3 update and was improved afterward. Both versions are described below. Both algorithms are deterministic (i.e., their result can be predicted ahead of time), so a fixed wiring layout will always activate the same Teleporters. Therefore, the wiring layout can be designed to target the desired Teleporter. The following images demonstrate the "relative-location-retaining" property of Teleporters described above.


=== Rain Cloud ===
Description: Rain Cloud is a type of block found beneath Floating Islands, along with Cloud blocks. Rain Cloud blocks cause purely decorative raindrops to appear beneath them that fall for about 18 tiles before fading away for 5 more.

=== The Doctor's set ===
Description: The Doctor's set is a vanity set made up of the The Doctor's Shirt and The Doctor's Pants. They are purchased from the Clothier for 40 (set) in total, during Waning Gibbous. These items are to be equipped in the Social Slots as they only provide a visual appearance.


=== Gray Zapinator ===
Description: The Gray Zapinator is a pre-Hardmode-only magic weapon purchased from the Traveling Merchant for 17. It is only available once the Eye of Cthulhu, Eater of Worlds/Brain of Cthulhu, Queen Bee, or Skeletron has been defeated. Unlike the Zapinator, the Gray Zapinator does not autofire. Meteor armor's set bonus will reduce the mana cost of the Gray Zapinator (and Orange Zapinator) to 0, although the stated mana cost will not change. The weapon fires a laser beam which behaves very erratically. Upon striking an enemy, the projectile slows down by 40%, decreases its current damage and knockback by 10%, and can choose from an assortment of special effects as described below. The laser beam will disappear after hitting eight enemies or after 60 seconds. Its best modifier is Mythical. Upon hitting an enemy, the beam can do any (and perhaps more than one) of the following things:[1] These effects are applied in the given order. While it is possible for a projectile to trigger all of them at once upon hitting an enemy, it is also possible that none of them are triggered.


=== Nimbus Rod ===
Description: The Nimbus Rod is a Hardmode magic weapon that creates clouds that cause damaging "rain" projectiles to fire downward. When cast, a cloud projectile is fired from the rod and travels towards the cursor. Upon reaching its destination or colliding with a solid block, the cloud stops and starts sending rain particles downward. Each drop of rain deals the weapon's stated damage and pierces through up to 5 enemies. Each cloud lasts for 5 minutes. Up to two clouds can be spawned at once; using the weapon when there are already two active clouds will cause the oldest cloud to disappear. The Nimbus Rod has a 6.67*1/15 (6.67%) chance of dropping from an Angry Nimbus, which spawns during rain. Its best modifier is Demonic or Deadly for damage output, or Mystic for mana conservation because it cannot get modifiers that affect knockback. Because of the weapon's negligible mana cost, Demonic is usually preferred.


=== Chlorophyte Ore ===
Description: Chlorophyte Ore is a Hardmode ore found in the Underground Jungle that is used to craft Chlorophyte Bars. When Hardmode starts, Mud Blocks located near Jungle grass blocks (i.e., most often only in the Underground Jungle) will begin to convert themselves into Chlorophyte Ore. A pickaxe or drill with at least 200% pickaxe power is required to mine it, meaning it requires the Pickaxe Axe or Drax at the very least, whose materials require defeating all three mechanical bosses (although on Windows Phone and 3DS, the Drax can sometimes be found in Shadow Chests). Chlorophyte Ore will slowly spread itself by converting adjacent Mud and Jungle grass blocks into more Chlorophyte Ore, growing to large deposits over time. Furthermore, this allows it to be "replanted" and artificially seeded for a nearly renewable source of Chlorophyte. On the PC version, Console version, Mobile version, Old Chinese version, tModLoader version, and tModLoader 1.3-Legacy version, Chlorophyte will also attempt to spread by converting nearby Dirt Blocks to Mud, as well as Corrupt, Crimson, Hallowed and regular grass blocks to Jungle grass. Chlorophyte Ore can only spread and convert blocks if it is in or below the bottom half of the Underground layer. It can only spread itself to directly adjacent tiles (and only if there is not too much Chlorophyte nearby already) and can only convert tiles up to five tiles away.

=== Spider Wall ===
Description: The Spider Wall is a background wall found naturally generated in Spider Nests, where they are considered unsafe. The player can create safe Spider Walls via crafting, and unsafe Spider Walls by placing Infested Spider Wall (obtained by throwing a crafted Spider Wall into Shimmer). Unsafe Spider Walls will drop nothing when destroyed with a hammer. They can spawn Wall Creepers in pre-Hardmode and Black Recluses in Hardmode, and therefore cannot be used for proper housing. They can create Cobwebs over time, with a 25*1/4 (25%) chance to yield a Cobweb item when destroyed. Infested Spider Walls, visually identical to Spider Walls, can be placed to enlarge an existing Spider Nest, or create a new one. Safe Spider Walls are crafted. Like other craftable walls, they drop as an item if destroyed with a hammer, and do not spawn enemies once placed, making them suitable for housing. They do not spawn Cobwebs nor contribute to a Spider Nest biome.

=== Vilethorn ===
Description: The Vilethorn is a magic weapon that extends a 15-tile-long spear-like projection from the player's position. It passes through blocks, pierces multiple enemies, and scores a rapid succession of up to 7 hits per enemy. Its total effect lasts roughly 1.5 seconds. It is one of the possible drops from destroying a Shadow Orb in the Corruption, but it can also be obtained from Corrupt Crates, which are caught from fishing in the Corruption. The Vilethorn also inflicts minuscule knockback for each hit, which can stun-lock enemies. Its best modifier is Mythical.


=== Gold Bunny ===
Description: The Gold Bunny is a harmless Critter. It is a recolor of an ordinary Bunny, with a 0.25*1/400 (0.25%) / 0.67*1/150 (0.67%) chance of spawning in place of the ordinary version. However, it cannot be spawned by a Bunny Statue. As with all other gold critters, it can be caught with a Bug Net and sold for 10. It is one of the few entities that can be detected by the Lifeform Analyzer or its upgrades. The Bestiary entry for the Gold Bunny: "Rarely, critters are found coated entirely in gold!

=== Ropes ===
Description: Ropes are placeable items that primarily provide quick vertical mobility. They can be placed adjacent to blocks in any direction, or in midair where background walls are present. Once placed, Ropes are used by pressing ▲ Up or ▼ Down while moving over them. Streamers and Chains operate identically to Rope, but cannot be crafted into Rope Coils. All Rope variants operate identically, but Silk and Web Ropes are immune to falling lava, as opposed to normal and Vine Ropes, which will be dislodged similar to Torches. All ropes are acquired in different ways: Visually, the player appears to move along Rope using a mechanical tool with wheels, as though they were riding a rail. This tool appears automatically when using Rope, does not exist as a separate item, and is available from the beginning of the game. Vertical movement speed on Rope equals that of a free fall, though moving down via Rope and hitting the ground will not cause fall damage. Horizontal movement is also possible, by placing adjacent Rope horizontally, but is much slower. Rope can be placed atop existing placed Rope, which will extend the total length of the rope downward, without the player actually having to be at the bottom of the Rope column. All Rope types can be crafted into their respective Rope Coils, consumable items useful for placing Ropes in inaccessible locations.

Description: The Frozen Crown is a pet-summoning item that has a 12.5*1/8 (12.5%) to 25*1/4 (25%) chance of dropping from the Ice Queen in Master Mode. It summons a miniature Ice Queen pet that will follow the player around.


=== Pwnhammer ===
Description: The Pwnhammer is a Hardmode hammer that is able to destroy Demon Altars and Crimson Altars with a few hits, blessing the world with one of the six Hardmode ores. It is always dropped by the Wall of Flesh. It has a sparkle effect when used which gives off a good deal of light, even in complete darkness. Its best modifier is Light for harvesting purposes and Legendary for combat purposes.


=== Psycho Knife ===
Description: The Psycho Knife is a Hardmode, post-Plantera melee weapon that has a 2.5*1/40 (2.5%) / 4.94*79/1600 (4.94%) chance to be dropped by the Psycho during the Solar Eclipse event. When holding the Psycho Knife and standing still, the player will quickly enter stealth mode, causing them to turn almost completely transparent, move much more slowly, and no longer be targeted by enemies. Stealth mode is engaged gradually over the course of about one second, during which the weapon's stats are steadily boosted up to the following values: Stealth mode is disengaged when successfully attacking an enemy, when switching to a different weapon or when riding a mount. Swinging the weapon alone does not cancel stealth, nor does walking or flying. Standing still again afterward re-engages it. Moving or swinging the weapon during the one-second transition period, however, will cancel stealth mode. Its best modifier is Legendary. Due to rounding, the Light modifier gives the same speed bonus as Legendary, with fewer other bonuses.


=== Bone Helm ===
Description: The Bone Helm is an Expert Mode accessory obtained from the Treasure Bag dropped by the Deerclops. When equipped, it summons Shadow Hands to damage enemies. These Shadow Hands are spawned a distance from enemies before flying at them, piercing anything in their path including blocks. Their flight behavior mirrors the Shadow Hands found in the Deerclops fight, either flying straight or swerving harshly in flight. The hands can pierce a maximum of three enemies, and are not affected by any damage buffs.


=== Moon Shell ===
Description: The Moon Shell is a Hardmode accessory that can be crafted at the Tinkerer's Workshop. It combines the effects of the Moon Charm and the Neptune's Shell: Equipping it will turn the player into a Merfolk when entering water (at any time), or into a Werewolf at night.

=== Adamantite Drill ===
Description: The Adamantite Drill is a Hardmode drill, and is the drill alternative to the Adamantite Pickaxe. Appearances and sounds aside, the two tools are nearly functionally identical. The drill, however is half a second faster. But, unlike pickaxes, most drills cannot be reforged with size, speed, or knockback modifiers. It can mine any block except Chlorophyte Ore and Lihzahrd Bricks. Its best modifier is Demonic, as it does not have any knockback and thus cannot get modifiers that affect it, and furthermore cannot get modifiers that affect its speed, either.

Appearances and sounds aside, the two tools are nearly functionally identical. The drill, however, is half a second faster. But, unlike pickaxes, most drills cannot be reforged with size, speed, or knockback modifiers. The Chlorophyte Drill can mine any block except Lihzahrd Bricks. Its best modifier is Godly or Demonic.

=== Platinum Shortsword ===
Description: The Platinum Shortsword is the platinum equivalent of the Gold Shortsword. It is currently the second most powerful shortsword in the game, and the strongest ore-based shortsword. It deals more damage and attacks faster than its gold alternative, and is surpassed in base damage by the Gladius. Like all shortswords, the Platinum Shortsword has a very limited range and attacks with a stabbing motion at any direction on PC, Console, Mobile, and tModLoader, and horizontally in front of the player on Old-gen console, Windows Phone, Old Chinese, 3DS, and tModLoader Legacy, instead of an arc. This makes it almost useless against flying or jumping enemies, although its high attack rate makes it somewhat effective against weaker fighter type enemies. Its best modifier is Legendary.

=== Adamantite Waraxe ===
Description: The Adamantite Waraxe is a Hardmode axe that is obtainable after crafting an Adamantite Forge or a Titanium Forge, and is the axe alternative to the Adamantite Chainsaw. Along with its slightly stronger alternate, the Titanium Waraxe, it is stronger than the Mythril or Orichalcum Waraxe, making it one of the strongest that can be obtained before defeating the mechanical bosses. Like all other axes and chainsaws, it is solely used to cut down trees, cacti and Giant Glowing Mushrooms. Its best modifier is Legendary. While Light may seem to provide a better speed boost by percentages, rounding reveals that Legendary and Light mine at equal speeds for this tool.

=== Clinger Staff ===
Description: The Clinger Staff is a Hardmode magic weapon that has a 20*1/5 (20%) chance to be dropped by a Corrupt Mimic. It generates a 15-tile-high wall of Cursed Flame, which deals damage and inflicts the Cursed Inferno debuff to any enemy that walks through it. The point at which the wall is generated must be in a direct line of sight; otherwise, the wall will not generate, though still consume mana. The Clinger Staff's wall lasts for 5 minutes. Only one wall may be generated at a time; if another is summoned, the first one will vanish. Its best modifier is Ruthless. The Mythical modifier provides the widest array of stat bonuses, but the only stats that improve damage output are damage and critical chance. Switching to a different magic weapon causes existing projectiles to use that weapon's critical chance instead, meaning that the Clinger Staff's DPS is optimized with the Ruthless modifier when used in the intended way.


=== Daybloom ===
Description: Daybloom is a type of Herb that appears as a small yellow flower with a straight stem. It grows naturally on Grass and can be collected with virtually any Weapon or Tool. Daybloom can also be planted in Clay Pots and Planter Boxes using Daybloom Seeds, or gathered by defeating Angry Dandelions. Dayblooms usually grow during the Day. If the yellow sunflower-like head is visible, the Daybloom is blooming and ready to be harvested. If cut during the day, 1-3 Daybloom Seeds and 1 Daybloom will drop. Both Daybloom and their respective seeds have a chance to be obtained from the Herb Bag.

=== True Night's Edge ===
Description: The True Night's Edge is a Hardmode sword. It almost has the highest base damage of any Pre-Plantera sword only being beaten by the Chlorophyte Claymore. It is also a stronger version of the Night's Edge, doing more damage and firing a glowing, spinning, green circle projectile called "Night Beam" in the direction of the cursor every .86 seconds on average. Because this ability has a short cooldown, not every swing of the sword launches a Night Beam. The True Night's Edge is one of the ingredients required to craft the Terra Blade. On the PC, Console, Mobile, 3DS, and tModLoader versions, the True Night's Edge is able to autoswing. As of 1.4.4, the True Night's Edge now fires a spinning purple and green energy blade. This projectile is unique in that it moves with the player, meaning if the player is falling quickly and swings the sword, the projectile will not get left behind, and will stay in the same position relative to the player, albeit flying away. This can make it difficult to use, especially against bosses, as it forces the player to remain aligned with an enemy in order to use the projectile effectively, which makes dodging while firing sword projectiles at an enemy less viable. Its best modifier is Legendary. PC version, Console version, Mobile version, and tModLoader version: Old-gen console version, Windows Phone version, Old Chinese version, Nintendo 3DS version, and tModLoader 1.3-Legacy version:

=== Hat Rack ===
Description: The Hat Rack is a decorative furniture item that can be used to display up to two helmet-slot armor and vanity items, as well as dyes. Items can be placed on a Hat Rack by pressing the ⚷ Interact button on it, which opens a small set of inventory-like slots beneath the player's main inventory. There are two slots for two helmets, in addition to an associated dye slot underneath each one. Placing items in these slots immediately displays them on the Hat Rack. Items placed in the left slot are displayed on the upper part of the Hat Rack, while items placed in the right slot are displayed on the lower part. Items cannot be displayed on the middle, top part.

=== Marrow ===
Description: The Marrow is a Hardmode bow that has a 0.5*1/200 (0.5%) chance to be dropped by Skeleton Archers. When fired, the next available arrow will instead be converted into a special Bone Arrow, which fires at a higher velocity than average arrows. However, while the used arrow's base damage is accounted for, special properties of converted arrows are entirely lost. The Marrow has a base 9% critical strike chance, as opposed to the usual 4%. Its best modifier is Unreal.


=== Deerclops Eyeball ===
Description: The Deerclops Eyeball is a pet-summoning item that has a 25*1/4 (25%) chance of dropping from the Deerclops in Master Mode. It summons a Tiny Deerclops that will follow the player around. If it is too far away from the player, a bird will carry it by its horn to continue following the player.


=== Dart Trap ===
Description: Dart Traps are traps that fire poisoned darts when triggered via wire. The trap does not consume any ammunition, its output being limited only by how frequently it can be triggered, which is a maximum of once every 3 1/3 seconds ( 3 seconds). Dart Traps are found naturally placed in random areas in the Cavern layer, and more frequently in the Dungeon, and can be freed and harvested by players with a pickaxe or drill. They are found wired to Pressure Plates that trigger when the player or an enemy steps on them. In order to use harvested Dart Traps, players must wire them to a triggering mechanism that sends a signal to the trap, which can be done with tools available from the Mechanic (who can be found in the Dungeon after Skeletron is defeated). Dart Traps will be placed facing the direction the player is facing, and on the PC version, Console version, Mobile version, tModLoader version, and tModLoader 1.3-Legacy version, can be hammered to rotate them after being placed, allowing them to fire vertically.


=== Waterleaf ===
Description: Waterleaf is a type of herb which appears as a very small, aqua-colored sprout. It can be found growing on Sand and Pearlsand Blocks and can be cut with virtually any weapon or tool. On PC, Console, Mobile, Old Chinese, tModLoader, and tModLoader Legacy, it can also be planted in Clay Pots and Planter Boxes using Waterleaf Seeds, which drop from blooming Waterleaf. Waterleaf will only bloom once fully grown and when it is raining or snowing. While blooming, its appearance will change, becoming larger and speckled with aqua leaves. A blooming Waterleaf will also emit little globes of water. Note that it does not need to be raining or snowing directly on the plant in order for it to bloom: rain or snow simply needs to occur. On the Nintendo 3DS version, Waterleaf plants are required to be at least partially submerged in water before they bloom and drop seeds. It does not matter if it is raining or not. Both Waterleaf and their respective seeds have a chance to be obtained from the Herb Bag.

=== Explosive Bunny ===
Description: The Explosive Bunny is an item that serves as ammunition for the Bunny Cannon. Crafting it requires a Bunny, which must be caught with any Bug Net. It can be released as a critter, and will wander around like other critters. On death, it will explode, dealing damage but not destroying tiles. It will always be placed at the player's feet when released, instead of at the cursor like most other critters. The Bestiary entry for the Explosive Bunny: "Not the typical garden-variety bunny. This one has been tampered with, and has an explosive temper as a result."

Description: Snow Walls are naturally-occurring background Walls found in Snow Biomes. They can be destroyed with the Hammer, but can't be picked up as an item. Old-gen console version, Windows Phone version, Old Chinese version, Nintendo 3DS version, and tModLoader 1.3-Legacy version Snow Walls cannot be crafted by the player. Therefore, they can never be placed or utilized in any other way by the player. PC version, Console version, Mobile version, and tModLoader version Snow Walls can be crafted from Snow Blocks at a Work Bench with Ecto Mist.

Like its lesser counterpart, the Dart Trap, it fires a dart when activated via wire, which costs no ammunition, but a cooldown period of 3.33 seconds / 3 seconds is required between firings. The dart is not affected by gravity and poisons the target, the poison lasting for 15 seconds and dealing 1 damage every half-second. The dart does less damage to the player at close range and roughly 80 damage to an unarmored player at further range. Unlike Lihzahrd Bricks, freeing Super Dart Traps does not require the Picksaw.

Its pre-Hardmode counterpart is the Dungeon Crate. Note: Only one type of ore and one type of bar can drop, not both a pre-Hardmode type of ore and a Hardmode type of ore, or both a pre-Hardmode type of bar and a Hardmode type of bar. The table above implies otherwise with the respective groups being in separate rows, but that is for readability purposes. The chance that a type of ore is dropped is 14.29*1/7 (14.29%), and the chance that a type of bar is dropped is 25*1/4 (25%).

It has a 5*1/20 (5%) / 2*1/50 (2%) chance of being dropped by Undead Miners, uncommon enemies found in the Cavern layer. It is tied with the Silver Pickaxe as the fastest pre-Hardmode pickaxe by mining speed, but has higher pickaxe power equal to that of the Gold Pickaxe, allowing it to mine Meteorite and destroy Dirt Blocks in a single hit. It is the fastest pickaxe for mining weak blocks, such as dirt and snow, until Hardmode, although that function is rendered largely obsolete by the Gravedigger's Shovel. Its best modifier is Light for harvesting purposes and Legendary for combat purposes.


=== Snow Block ===
Description: Snow Blocks are found naturally-placed in the Snow Biome. Snow Blocks placed in the Surface layer, either naturally or by a player, will cause a snowfall effect. This is purely visual, and has no functional effects. Snow Blocks cannot be Hallowed or Corrupted. Snow in any form cannot be melted into water, nor produced from water or ice. Snow blocks are also dropped by the Hardmode Frost Legion enemies, and its Snow Balla throws Snowballs that create further Snow blocks when impacting. Snowfall amount is determined by the number of Snow Blocks that are near your character. The same applies to Snow Bricks, which also cause snowfall. Snow Brick Walls do not cause snowfall on their own.

=== Jungle Turtle ===
Description: The Jungle Turtle is a critter that only serves as environment flavor and spawns in or near a body of water on the surface Jungle at any time. Due to them having only 5 HP and no defense, they are often killed instantly by enemies or the player itself. It is one of the few critters having no Gold variant. Like its Forest counterpart, it wanders around on land and swim at the surface of water. It can be caught with any Bug Net to be carried around in the inventory and released later, or crafted into a Jungle Turtle Cage to be used as decorative furniture.

=== Tungsten Shortsword ===
Description: The Tungsten Shortsword is an early game metal shortsword. It is slightly more powerful than its Silver version. Like all shortswords, the Tungsten Shortsword has a very limited range and attacks with a stabbing motion at any direction on PC, Console, Mobile, and tModLoader, and horizontally in front of the player on Old-gen console, Windows Phone, Old Chinese, 3DS, and tModLoader Legacy, instead of an arc. This makes it almost useless against flying or jumping enemies, although its high attack rate makes it somewhat effective against weaker fighter type enemies. Unless the player has a good reason to make the Shortsword (like not having very much Tungsten, or for completionist purposes) they are advised to make the Tungsten Broadsword, as it does more damage and can swing in an arc. Its best modifier is Legendary.

They were slightly transparent.


=== SWAT Helmet ===

=== Copper Broadsword ===
Description: The Copper Broadsword is arguably the weakest of the early game metal broadswords. It has a slightly stronger alternate version, the Tin Broadsword. As with all other broadswords, this sword is swung overhead, which makes it easier to defeat flying and jumping monsters than shortswords. This sword is generally more useless than the other early game metal broadswords. There are also other swords that are easier to acquire early game and that deal more damage than this sword, such as the Ebonwood Sword or Shadewood Sword. Its best modifier is Legendary.

=== Inner Tube ===
Description: The Inner Tube is an accessory that causes the player to float on the surface of liquids instead of sinking to the bottom. The effect can be temporarily negated by holding ▼ Down. It can be found in Water Chests, as well as Ocean Crates and Seaside Crates. While wearing the Inner Tube, and floating in water the players fishing power is increased by 5. The Inner Tube's effects are replaced with the Flipper's effect if the player is holding a Trident. Neptune's Shell, its derivative accessories, and Flipper Potion will override the Inner Tube's effects entirely; causing the player to sink.


=== Aqua Scepter ===
Description: The Aqua Scepter is a magic weapon that can be obtained from Locked Gold Chests within the Dungeon, or from Golden Lock Boxes found in Dungeon Crates from fishing. It auto-fires an arc of water particles which can pierce an infinite number of enemies. The Aqua Scepter can be continuously used to keep enemies juggled. However, the sprite of the Aqua Scepter itself deals no damage. Therefore, an enemy too close to the wielder will not get hit by the water, and simply move past the outstretched wand to hit the player. Its best modifier is Mythical.


=== Vortex Dye ===
Description: Vortex Dye is a Hardmode dye crafted from Vortex Fragments dropped by the Vortex Pillar in the Lunar Events and Bottled Water. The effect produced is reminiscent of a green warp drive effect on all clothing and accessories the dye is applied to.

=== Detonator ===
Description: Detonators are activation Mechanisms that can be found underground as part of Traps, wired to Explosives. They are often found planted on top of suspiciously large veins of underground metals (E.g. Silver). Detonators act as switches, sending an activation trigger to other mechanisms connected to it through Wire. They are tripped either by right-clicking or when a player falls on the plunger, similar to a Pressure Plate. Unlike pressure plates, a player has to actually fall from above to trigger a detonator. Even walking off a 1.5 block high column will not work, while walking off a 2 block high column reliably triggers it. This makes explosive traps that use a detonator instead of a pressure plate slightly less dangerous as they are more difficult to trigger accidentally (as well as much easier to see). A detonator is not triggered by enemies or NPCs falling on it. When triggered by player, a detonator disables itself for one second. When activated by a wire, it is disabled until it is activated by wire again. When it is disabled, plunger is stuck down and it cannot be triggered by a player clicking it or falling on it.

Description: The Hanging Skeleton is a decorative furniture item that can be placed on background walls. It can be found in the Dungeon, where they only appear in areas backed by Slab or Tile Walls.

The Fireworks Box is purchased from the Party Girl for 5.


=== Snowball Cannon ===
Description: The Snowball Cannon is a ranged weapon which uses Snowballs as ammunition. It can be found inside Frozen Chests in the Ice biome, as well as Frozen and Boreal Crates. Its best modifier is Unreal.


=== Dirt Walls (natural) ===
Description: Dirt Walls are naturally-generating background walls found in the Underground layer. These naturally occurring walls can be destroyed with a hammer, but will drop nothing. These walls also do not stop enemies from spawning and cannot be used for proper housing. On the PC version, Console version, Mobile version, and tModLoader version, these walls can be crafted from Dirt where they can be used like other craftable walls.

Its best modifier is Godly or Demonic. Both modifiers increase the average damage output by the same amount.


=== Ninja armor ===
Description: Ninja armor or Ninja set is an armor/vanity set made up of the Ninja Hood, Ninja Shirt and Ninja Pants. King Slime drops each piece separately (1 per kill with a 1:3 chance each), or two pieces from the Treasure Bag it drops in Expert Mode. In the Nintendo 3DS version, pieces of the Ninja set can also be acquired from Lepus, but with only a 3% chance. In all versions though, having the full set equipped grants an after-image movement effect, similar to Shadow, Necro, and Cobalt armors.


=== Meteor armor ===
Description: The Meteor armor is an armor set that consists of the Meteor Helmet, Meteor Suit, and Meteor Leggings. Equipping the full set reduces the mana cost of the Space Gun to 0. In the PC version, Console version, Mobile version, and tModLoader version, the Gray Zapinator and Orange Zapinator are also affected by this change. Each piece of the armor worn increases magic damage by 9% / 7%. If the full set is visible, the player leaves a trail of flames as they move. Crafting a full set requires a total of 45 / 60 Meteorite Bars (135 / 180 Meteorite ore).

=== Blinkroot ===
Description: Blinkroot is a common Herb that grows naturally on Dirt or Mud blocks, regardless of lighting or elevation, so long as there is room for it to grow and the blocks bear no Grass of any kind. It is most commonly found in the Underground Layer and below, due to the general lack of grass in those areas. It can be harvested with any Weapon or Tool. Blinkroot can be planted manually using Blinkroot Seeds, which can also be planted in Clay Pots and Planter Boxes. If the dirt block that the blinkroot is planted on turns into a grass block the blinkroot will break, dropping as an item. Blinkroot emits pulsating light ("blinks") while in bloom. It enters and exits its in-bloom phase randomly, and has no particular blooming requirements. Harvesting it while in-bloom will drop 1-3 Blinkroot Seeds in addition to the Blinkroot item. It is by far the fastest-growing herb in the game, capable of being harvested within seconds of planting. Both Blinkroot and their respective seeds have a chance to be obtained from the Herb Bag.

Description: The Gold Broadsword is the highest tier of early game metal broadswords, being stronger than the Silver Broadsword, yet is slightly weaker than its alternate version, the Platinum Broadsword. Like all broadswords, this sword has an arc motion, which is more useful for killing flying and jumping monsters than shortswords. While it doesn't do much damage, its faster speed means that it is equally if not more powerful than the War Axe of the Night. Its best modifier is Legendary.

=== Chlorophyte Extractinator ===
Description: The Chlorophyte Extractinator is a post-Mech-Boss upgrade to the Extractinator. It is a furniture item that converts Silt, Slush, and Desert Fossils into more valuable items such as ores, coins, and gems, as well as fishing trash into low level bait. The Chlorophyte Extractinator converts items faster, can produce Hardmode ores, and can also exchange Glowing Mosses into all kinds of mosses (except Helium Moss), instead of only regular ones. It can also turn the Corruption, Crimson, and Hallow variants of most blocks into their normal variants, but cannot be used in reverse. Alongside this, it can also be used to convert ores/bars into their alternate ore types (such as Tin being converted into Copper and vice-versa), and Dungeon Bricks into their variants. To use the Chlorophyte Extractinator, it first needs to be placed in the world. Afterward, suitable blocks need to be consumed (with the ⚒ Use / Attack key) directly on the Chlorophyte Extractinator within its 3×3 frame. Holding the Auto Select key and clicking on the Chlorophyte Extractinator will automatically insert extractable items from the player's inventory without having to pick them up manually. Information taken from the PC 1.4.4.6 source code, method ExtractinatorUse() in Terraria.Player.cs. There may be inaccuracies, as the current PC version is 1.4.4.9. Below is a list of items that are guaranteed to be exchanged to another item via the Chlorophyte Extractinator.[1]

=== Jester's Arrow ===
Description: Jester's Arrows are a type of arrow. They are considered an improvement over the Unholy Arrow, as they have no limit on the number of enemies they can pierce. This makes them efficient against enemies with multiple sections such as the Eater of Worlds. Due to their piercing effect, they can sometimes be better than stronger arrows, such as the Hellfire Arrow. They also emit light when fired, meaning they can be used to temporarily light up caves. However, Jester's Arrows will explode in a firework effect after hitting something or reaching their maximum range. This means that, unlike other arrows, they can not be recovered after hitting an enemy or a wall (As of 1.4, no arrows can be recovered after being fired). In addition to being crafted, Jester's Arrows can also be found in Gold Chests in the Underground and Cavern layers.

Description: A Phasesaber is a Hardmode / pre-Hardmode broadsword which is a direct upgrade to the pre-Hardmode Phaseblade. It is very similar to its predecessor, except dealing about twice as much damage, being capable of autoswing, and having slightly modified visuals. As with Phaseblades, there are seven / six different color variations with identical statistics, with the color determined by the color of the Phaseblade used to craft it. All Phasesabers emit a small amount of light when swung. Because Arch Demons drop Crystal Shards on the Windows Phone version and Nintendo 3DS version and only a pre-Hardmode Anvil is required for crafting it, the Phasesaber is available pre-Hardmode on this version. Its best modifier is Legendary.

=== Boreal Wood Bow ===
Description: The Boreal Wood Bow is a type of bow crafted from Boreal Wood. It is similar to the Wooden Bow, but it deals 2 more damage and has a higher velocity. Because Snow biomes are usually not too far from the initial spawn point, a Boreal Wood Bow can be a superior alternative to its standard counterpart. Its best modifier is Demonic, as it does not have any knockback and thus cannot get modifiers that affect it. It can also get the Deadly modifier, which, while the Demonic modifier may provide the greatest damage per hit, grants a higher increase to the overall DPS.

Description: The Charm of Myths is a Hardmode accessory which combines the effects of the Band of Regeneration and the Philosopher's Stone. When equipped, it regenerates 1 / 0.5 health every second and decreases the duration of the Potion Sickness debuff when consuming potions by 25%.

This allows players to keep the accessory in their inventory or an accessory vanity slot and quickly equip it to heal, then swap it back for another accessory. Potion Sickness is only reduced while the accessory is equipped. Specifically, when equipped, Potion Sickness is multiplied by 0.75, and when unequipped it is divided by 0.75.

It is also possible to spawn Hearts (and their seasonal counterparts) with a Heart Statue. Hearts can be collected within a range of 2 blocks, which can be increased with a Heartreach Potion.


=== Azure Crate ===
Description: The Azure Crate is a Hardmode crate that can only be fished at high elevations, such as in Floating Lakes. Azure Crates contain items found in standard crates, and they always contain an item normally found in Skyware Chests.

However, they will not emit light if fired into water. Flaming Arrows are recoverable after hitting a wall or enemy 1/3 of the time, but only 1/3 of those that do remain lit; the rest drop as Wooden Arrows. Wooden Arrows fired from the Molten Fury behave similarly and have a chance to be recovered as Flaming Arrows.

It is purchased from the Skeleton Merchant for 10, during the night of a full moon. The lantern will always try to maintain a position just forward of and above the player, passing through blocks as needed. If the player gets far enough away, the lantern will propel itself with a rocket exhaust in order to catch up. The lantern's position can block objects of interest at ceiling height, but if the player just turns around, the lantern will move to their other side.

Description: The Electrosphere Launcher is a Hardmode, post-Golem launcher that fires rockets to the position of the cursor, then forms an energy-emanating ball of constant damage for approximately 8 seconds. An infinite number of electrospheres can be summoned, but they cannot overlap. The Electrosphere Launcher has a 16.67*1/6 (16.67%) / 11.11*1/9 (11.11%) chance to be dropped by the Martian Saucer during the Martian Madness event. Its best modifier is Unreal.


=== Spore Sac ===
Description: The Spore Sac is a Hardmode accessory that is obtained from the Treasure Bag dropped by Plantera in Expert Mode. When equipped, it continuously spawns multiple stationary floating spores around the player that act as homing mines. When an enemy comes within range, they slowly swarm the enemy and cause small explosions on contact, dealing about 400 damage over 1 second. Spores have the ability to pass through blocks to reach enemies, and will inflict the Poisoned debuff. They have a small area-effect that can hit multiple targets. Spores can only spawn near blocks, or on background walls, that are up to 25 tiles away from the player. Flying in open areas (eg. via Wings or Mounts) with no walls or blocks in range will not result in any spores spawned. When spawning near blocks, with no background walls, only a single layer of spores spawns, floating within about 3 tiles of the blocks. On background walls, spores can spawn anywhere in mid-air.


=== Bladed Glove ===
Description: The Bladed Glove is a rare fast-hitting melee weapon with a very short range that can drop only during the Halloween seasonal event. It can be a very effective weapon when fighting pre-Hardmode melee enemies due to the high speed, and therefore, damage output. The Fetid Baghnakhs can be considered its Hardmode upgrade. Its best modifier is Legendary. The Bladed Glove has a 0.05*1/2000 (0.05%) chance of being dropped by any weak enemy during the Halloween seasonal event. Weak enemies are enemies with less than 20 defense, 40 damage and up to 5 of loot. These will be mostly pre hardmode enemies. When playing in expert mode all enemies are much stronger and therefore these conditions limit the number of enemies that can drop the Bloody Machete and Bladed Glove to just a couple, especially during hardmode. See the table below for clarification.


=== Wrenches ===
Description: Wrenches are tools for placing Wire. Wires are used to connect mechanisms together, such as a trap with a Pressure Plate. All Wrenches are purchased from the Mechanic for 2 each. Holding a wrench allows players to see laid wires. Wires exist in their own layer, and thus can be placed over furniture, blocks, and walls. There are currently four different Wrenches: the Red Wrench, Green Wrench, Blue Wrench, and the Yellow Wrench, each placing its respective color of Wire. All Wrenches use the same ordinary Wire item as ammunition, but the color of Wrench used will determine the color of wire when placed. The colors all function identically, but can be placed so as to overlap or intersect each other without interfering with each other. Junction Boxes can further be used to keep intersecting Wire paths of the same color from interfering with each other. All four wrenches can be combined to make a Multicolor Wrench, a single tool that can place Wire of any color. Ordinary Wrenches cannot be used to remove placed wires. Instead, a Wire Cutter, or one of its derivatives (Multicolor Wrench, Grand Design) is required. All Wire colors become the same ordinary Wire item again when freed.

Description: Silt Blocks are a type of soil that are very similar to Sand Blocks that start appearing from the underground surface (very rarely).

It looks similar to Ash Blocks, but is a lighter color. Silt can be placed on an Extractinator to spawn various valuable materials, including gems, coins, ores, and very rarely, the Amber Mosquito pet summoning item.

=== Torch God's Favor ===
Description: Torch God's Favor is a consumable item obtained by surviving The Torch God event. Upon use, it permanently grants the player the ability to automatically convert regular Torches and Campfires in the player's hand to the current biome's Torch/Campfire variant, which positively influences the player's luck in most areas. Torch God's Favor is a one-time consumable whose effect cannot stack (similar to Advanced Combat Techniques or the Demon Heart). When first used, the ability is switched on by default. It can then be toggled off and on via a biome torch swap icon appearing in the upper-left of the inventory (similar to The Grand Design). Torches placed with biome torch swap toggled on will permanently remain converted to the biome torch they were placed as, even if freed and picked up. Here's the list of torches/campfires and their respective biomes:

=== Sandcastle Bucket ===
Description: The Sandcastle Bucket is a tool that places a decorative sandcastle and consumes one Sand Block upon use. It can be used on all variants of Sand Blocks and platforms, in any biome. Sandcastles are background furniture objects, but they cannot be picked up; using a pickaxe or drill on them destroys them immediately. The Sandcastle Bucket can be found randomly in Water Chests, Ocean Crates, and Seaside Crates. When the cursor is moved over a valid block, one out of four sandcastle styles will be selected randomly. Moving the cursor over a different block will produce a different sandcastle preview, so players can choose the particular sandcastle variant they wish to place by moving their cursor back and forth.

=== Neptune's Shell ===
Description: Neptune's Shell is a Hardmode accessory that aids performance underwater (and in other liquids) by granting indefinite breathing time underwater, swimming via the ↷ Jump key, and eliminating the slow movement speed usually caused by water. Entering water with this accessory equipped transforms the player into Merfolk form. While in this form, the breath meter will not display (nor will it decrease), therefore effectively preventing drowning. Neptune's Shell can be considered an upgrade from the Diving Gear in most respects, but lacks the extra mobility on ice of the Arctic Diving Gear and the extra lighting underwater of the Jellyfish Necklace.

=== Stellar Tune ===
Description: The Stellar Tune is a Hardmode, post-Plantera magic weapon with a 2*1/50 (2%) / 5*1/20 (5%) chance to be dropped by the Empress of Light. It fires pairs of star-shaped projectiles that travel in a wave-like pattern towards the cursor. Said projectiles home on enemies, pass through solid blocks, and explode in a small radius on impact. It plays an acoustic guitar chord when fired, based on the distance between the player and the cursor (in a similar fashion to the Magical Harp). There are a total of six chords: each one spans about a four-block distance from the player, except for the last one, which is played at a distance of 21 blocks or more. The distance from the player to the cursor also controls the speed at which projectiles are fired. However, if the projectiles are seeking an enemy, they will instead determine their speed based on the distance to that enemy. The Stellar Tune has similarities to Ocram's second form laser attacks. Its best modifier is Mythical.

=== Prismatic Lacewing ===
Description: The Prismatic Lacewing is a rare flying critter that spawns in the surface Hallow from dusk (7:30 PM) until midnight (12:00 AM) after Plantera has been defeated. When killed by a player, it summons the Empress of Light; death from non-player sources other than Fallen Stars will not result in summoning. The Prismatic Lacewing can be caught with a Bug Net. Releasing it from the inventory (with ⚒ Use / Attack) and killing it will still summon the Empress of Light (though it will quickly disappear if released outside of the Hallow). Only one Lacewing can be naturally spawned at a time. It can also be used to craft a Prismatic Lacewing Jar. It is one of the few entities that can be detected by the Lifeform Analyzer or its upgrades.

=== Nettle Burst ===
Description: The Nettle Burst is a Hardmode magic weapon that fires a 24-tile-long snaking vine projection that lingers for several seconds, traveling through blocks and infinitely piercing enemies. It is an upgrade of the Vilethorn and Crystal Vile Shard, having a 14.29*1/7 (14.29%) / 16.67*1/6 (16.67%) chance to be dropped by Plantera. The Nettle Burst scores a rapid succession of up to 9 hits on enemies (compared to the Vilethorn's 7 hits). Each hit delivers the weapon's full damage, or over 250 damage total on any enemy that remains in its affected area for its full duration. Like the Vilethorn, the Nettle Burst produces minuscule knockback for each of its rapid hits. This tends to have the effect of nearly freezing enemies in place for the duration of each swing. Enemies that are immune to knockback do not have their movement impeded. Like the Crystal Vile Shard, the Nettle Burst ignores up to 10 of the target's defense. Its best modifier is Mythical.


=== Nebula Blaze ===

The Nebula Blaze fires inaccurately, akin to the Chain Gun and similar weapons – however, its projectiles are homing from a certain angle, similar to the Spectre Staff. When selected, it appears as a pink glow covering the player's hand which leaves behind a pink particle trail as the player moves. Its best modifier is Mythical.

=== Fairies ===
Description: The Pink Fairy, Green Fairy, and Blue Fairy are peaceful Critters found in the Surface layer or below which will attempt to lead the player to valuable treasures which include life crystals, chests, life fruits, and ore deposits. Fairies will only spawn if at least one fallen log has been left in the world without being destroyed, otherwise they will no longer spawn independently. The three Fairy variants all function identically. There is a 1.392% chance that Fairy will emerge from a shaken tree in the Hallow at night. These fairies will spawn even if all Fallen Logs in the world have been broken. While a fairy is nearby, enemy spawns are reduced, similar to (and stacking with) sunflowers.[1] When a fairy spawns underground (or a captured fairy is 'consumed' while underground), they will fly to and follow the player for quite a while. If they are within range of a treasure, they will briefly circle the player, emitting a soft chiming noise, then head in the direction of the treasure. They keep a certain distance from the player in order to encourage being followed. Once the fairy reaches the loot it is leading the player to, it will circle it briefly, then disappear in a burst of glowing glitter which illuminates the area for a few seconds before dying out. After 5 minutes, if the fairy has not led the player to a treasure and vanished, it will fly offscreen and despawn. The fairy will despawn if you leave the game. On the Surface at night, Fairies can sometimes spawn near Fallen Logs, and can then be caught with a Bug Net. These fairies will not try to lead players to treasure; instead, when approached, they try to flee much like birds. Every in-game minute, there is a 1/180 chance (or a 1/60 chance if during a new or full moon) of a fairy spawning above a random Fallen Log in the world, as long as any player cannot currently see the Fallen Log. Fairies found underground, which lead players to the treasure, cannot be caught or hurt. Fairies may lead players to several different types of loot: If there is no such loot in the vicinity, a Fairy will follow the player until it detects one, or until 5 minutes passes and the fairy just flies off. The Bestiary entry for the Fairies: "Glowing winged humanoid creatures the size of a butterfly. Attuned to the world around them, they excel at finding shiny things."

=== Superheated Blood ===
Description: The Superheated Blood is a mount-summoning item that summons a rideable Lava Shark Mount. It is obtained by opening Obsidian Crates or Hellstone Crates found by fishing in lava. Riding the mount will allow the player to swim very quickly in lava without taking damage. It can also swim in water and honey, but will not protect the player from drowning. It has a maximum speed of 73 mph in liquids and 11 mph on land. The mount maintains its velocity in the air, allowing for jumps similar to while riding a Minecart. When moving upwards or downwards, it tilts towards that direction.


=== Lava Absorbant Sponge ===
Description: The Lava Absorbant Sponge is an item which functions similarly to the Super Absorbant Sponge, but absorbs Lava instead of Water. When used on a tile occupied with lava, it will delete the tile. The Lava Absorbant Sponge can be used an unlimited amount of times. It also drains lava at a slightly faster speed than a standard empty bucket (especially when moving the cursor around while draining). It will not work on any other liquids. It is obtained as a rare drop from fishing in lava.

=== Pearlwood ===
Description: Pearlwood is the Hallowed form of Wood. Being a Hallowed item, it can only be obtained in Hardmode and from Floating Islands in the Celebrationmk10 secret seed. Pearlwood can be acquired by harvesting trees that have been afflicted by Hallow, which are easily distinguished by their vivid pastel-colored foliage. Pearlwood trees can also be planted anew in existing Hallow via Acorns. Items crafted from Pearlwood generally have much better stats than those crafted from normal Wood. For example, a Wooden Sword does 7 damage, while a Pearlwood Sword does 30 damage. However, since the player will need to have defeated the Wall of Flesh before Pearlwood becomes available, they will already likely have access to much higher tiers of equipment than any wooden form can provide.

=== True Excalibur ===
Description: The True Excalibur is a Hardmode sword which is incapable of autoswing. It is an amplified version of the Excalibur which uses Chlorophyte. The True Excalibur is one of the ingredients necessary to craft the Terra Blade. The True Excalibur, unlike the Excalibur, is not capable of autoswing. The True Excalibur fires a glowing pink sword projectile called "Light Beam" in the direction of the cursor every .48 seconds on average. Because this ability has a short cooldown, not every swing of the sword launches a Light Beam. After the 1.4.4 update, the True Excalibur now has a very large area of yellow and pink energy around the blade, dealing damage in a dramatically wider area of effect, including larger coverage behind the player, similar to the True Night's Edge. It no longer fires a projectile sword beam. Its best modifier is Legendary. PC version, Console version, Mobile version, and tModLoader version: Old-gen console version, Windows Phone version, Old Chinese version, Nintendo 3DS version, and tModLoader 1.3-Legacy version: Template:Eil/options Template:Eil/options

Description: The Amber Mosquito is a pet-summoning item that spawns a Baby Dinosaur to follow the player around. If it is too far away from the player, a pterosaur will carry it by the tail to continue following the player. This item can only be obtained by putting Silt, Slush, or Desert Fossil into an Extractinator. With Silt or Slush, it has a 0.01*1/10,000 (0.01%) chance to drop, with Desert Fossils it has a slightly higher chance of 0.027*27/100,000 (0.027%).[1] It does not produce light.

=== Climbing Claws ===
Description: Climbing Claws are an accessory that allow players to slowly slide down blocks when moving against them in midair. Jumps can also be performed off the sides of blocks. By repeatedly jumping against vertical blocks, they can be scaled. When sliding down, the slide speed can be accelerated using the ▼ Down key. Climbing Claws can be found in surface chests (including Water Chests) and have a 0.44*1/225 (0.44%) chance of being found in Wooden Crates and Pearlwood Crates, and they can also be purchased for 250 from the Skeleton Merchant during a Waxing Crescent. Climbing Claws function identically to Shoe Spikes, and when both Climbing Claws and Shoe Spikes are equipped, the player can hang from the sides of blocks, sliding down with the ▼ Down key. This effect can also be achieved if the Climbing Claws and Shoe Spikes are combined into the Tiger Climbing Gear at a Tinkerer's Workshop.

=== Portal Gun ===
Description: The Portal Gun is a Hardmode, post-Moon Lord tool which is always dropped by the Moon Lord. It launches projectiles capable of creating up to two portals (one fired by hitting ⚒ Use / Attack, the other by hitting ⚷ Interact) upon impact with blocks. These two portals are linked; any player that touches one will be instantly transported to the other one, without losing momentum. While NPCs can be teleported with the Portal Gun, enemies or projectiles cannot. The Portal Gun has a maximum range of 675 blocks (1350 feet). It takes about two seconds for the projectile to travel this distance. While selected, the Portal Gun will alter the player's physics: their maximum fall speed is multiplied by 3.5 (from 51 mph to 179 mph) and horizontal momentum/inertia is kept while in the air. This effect is also applied if the last entity that affected the player's fall was a portal. The extremely fast movement may cause performance losses on some devices.


=== Suspicious Grinning Eye ===
Description: The Suspicious Grinning Eye is a Master Mode-exclusive drop from the Eye of Cthulhu, with a 25*1/4 (25%) chance to drop. It summons a Suspicious Eye pet which resembles the Eye of Cthulhu. It normally shows a blue iris and pupil, but when moving at above certain speed the pupil slides up and reveals a mouth, similar to the Eye of Cthulhu's second form.


=== Demonite Ore ===
Description: Demonite Ore is a pre-Hardmode ore. It is the Corruption counterpart to the Crimson's Crimtane Ore, and will not appear naturally in Crimson worlds. It can be found very rarely in small veins underground in worlds that contain Corruption, however the only usable quantities come from bosses, namely Eater of Worlds, and from the Eye of Cthulhu in worlds naturally containing Corruption. Demonite Ore emits a faint blue glow when placed, similar to Crimtane Ore's faint red glow. The pickaxe power required to mine Demonite Ore changes with location. When below 0ft in elevation, a Gold Pickaxe or better is needed, otherwise any pickaxe can be used.

=== Confetti Gun ===
Description: The Confetti Gun is a consumable novelty weapon that fires a cloud of colorful confetti, and inflicts no damage. Its effect is purely visual and causes no functional effect. Confetti Guns are consumed upon use, and can therefore be used only once. They are purchased from the Party Girl for 1 each.


=== Volatile Gelatin ===
Description: The Volatile Gelatin is an accessory obtained from Queen Slime's Treasure Bag in Expert Mode. When equipped, it periodically fires a small, bouncing, purple projectile, similar to those of the Queen Slime, at a nearby enemy. The projectile deals 65 damage and a knockback of 7 (Strong); these values are unaffected by any boosts.[1] It pierces up to three enemies. The accessory has a fixed cycle: Once every 0.833 seconds (50 ticks[2]), it attempts to release a projectile in the direction of the nearest enemy. If there is no enemy within 40 tiles, no projectile will be fired and the accessory will go on cooldown for the following 50 ticks.


=== Proximity Mine Launcher ===
Description: The Proximity Mine Launcher is a Hardmode, post-Plantera launcher that fires mines which stick to blocks, remaining dormant and semi-transparent until a player or enemy approaches, or until a minute passes, at which point they explode. The Proximity Mine Launcher is purchased from the Cyborg for 35. The Proximity Mine Launcher uses rockets as ammunition. The mines are heavily affected by gravity and will only travel a short distance before dropping to the ground. The firing player will not actually trigger their detonation by getting close, although the firing player will take damage if they are within range of an exploding mine. Stationary mines will deal triple damage. This does not apply to mines that are still moving. The Cyborg uses the Proximity Mine Launcher to protect himself against nearby enemies. Its best modifier is Unreal.

=== Tinkerer's Workshop ===
Description: The Tinkerer's Workshop is a crafting station that is used primarily to combine multiple accessories into single items that usually provide the abilities of all. For instance, it can combine the Rocket Boots and Hermes Boots into a single item (the Spectre Boots) that provides the same rocket-jumping and accelerated movement as the individual items did, without occupying two accessory slots. The Tinkerer's Workshop is purchased from the Goblin Tinkerer for 10. When combining items, the Tinkerer's Workshop will assign a new random modifier to the crafted item. The modifiers the individual items had beforehand do not influence the modifier of the new combined item. Items crafted at the Tinkerer's Workshop will be assigned no modifier. The Tinkerer's Workshop is also used to craft a Boulder and the unique unrecordable Music Boxes Title (using all 12 first recorded Music Boxes) and Tutorial.

=== Lead Ore ===
Description: Lead Ore is an early-game ore that generates upon world creation on the surface, as well as in the Underground and Cavern layers. Its primary use is in crafting Lead Bars, which can then be used to craft the Lead tier of tools, weapons, and armor, as well as Buckets, Chains, and several other items. The equivalent of Lead Ore is Iron Ore, which will sometimes replace Lead in a world. Lead Ore has a small chance to appear as a bonus drop from Slimes. As Lead Bars are required to craft a Lead Anvil, Lead Ore must usually be obtained before any tools, weapons, or armor can be crafted from bars. While this can be circumvented by purchasing an Iron Anvil from the Merchant, that is generally inefficient, as it is not difficult to find 15 Lead Ore early on in the game.

=== Harpoon ===
Description: The Harpoon is a unique pre-Hardmode ranged weapon. It auto-fires an arcing projectile which is connected to the player via a chain, and returns after reaching a maximum distance or impacting. Its physics are similar to launched flails, though it is highly affected by gravity. The Harpoon is dropped by most enemies during a Goblin Army with a chance of 0.5*1/200 (0.5%). The Harpoon has no cooldown period; its auto-fire rate dependent only on the distance to its impact, meaning that an enemy or object in close range will cause a faster auto-fire rate. The projectile also deals damage and knockback to multiple enemies on its return trip, similar to a flail or boomerang, making it effective for crowd control. Its best modifier is Godly or Demonic. Both modifiers increase the average damage output by the same amount.


=== Rocket Boots ===
Description: Rocket Boots are an accessory that allows a player to fly for a period of around 1.7 seconds (100 game frames). They require a jump from midair to activate (a double-jump, or a jump while falling). During flight, they emit a jet animation that produces a good deal of light. Rocket Boots are purchased from the Goblin Tinkerer for 5. Flight time is reset immediately when the player lands on any solid object, or latches onto a surface with a Hook (even if you do not let it reel you all the way to the target). If the Cloud in a Bottle is also equipped, its double-jump effect will engage first; pressing and holding the jump key afterward while still in midair will then activate the Rocket Boots.

However, it can be used against groups of enemies and can reliably hit bosses and bigger enemies. Its best modifier is Unreal.

Description: Ice Cream is a food item that grants the Plenty Satisfied buff. This lasts for 14 minutes, but can be canceled at any time by selecting the icon and canceling it in the equipment menu () or by double-tapping the buff icon ().

Description: The Ball O' Hurt is a type of flail that is obtainable by destroying a Shadow Orb, or by looting a Corrupt Crate that is obtained by fishing in the Corruption. It emits small particles similar to those of other objects in the Corruption. It is particularly useful when fighting worm-type enemies or the Eater of Worlds boss, since it does relatively constant damage to the multiple segments. Its best modifier is Godly or Demonic. Both modifiers increase the average damage output by the same amount.


=== Junction Box ===
Description: The Junction Box is a mechanism that allows wires of the same color to cross without connecting. It is purchased from the Mechanic for 2. The Junction Box can be placed in midair, without the need for support. Hammering the Junction Box changes the directions that the different colored wires enter and exit the Junction Box.

It otherwise glides along the ground. Whether on the ground or hovering, its top speed is 41 mph. The max height of the mount can be increased using items that allow for multiple jumps such as the Cloud in a Bottle, though this only allows it to be multiplied by the number of times the player jumps. The altitude of the mount is also adjustable in the down direction by pressing ▼ Down. The Book Mount cancels fall damage.


=== Hellwing Bow ===
Description: The Hellwing Bow is a bow found in Shadow Chests found in the Underworld. On the PC version, Console version, Mobile version, and tModLoader version, it can also be found in the Obsidian Lock Box obtainable in Obsidian and Hellstone Crates. It converts normal Wooden Arrows into flaming bat projectiles that travel in a semi-straight line and can pierce infinitely. This is countered by the fact that the bats are fired in a ~30° cone and therefore can be very inaccurate at long distances. Additionally, the bats will dissipate once hitting a surface. Other arrows will not lose their special properties, but will inherit the inaccuracy of the bow. Its best modifier is Unreal.


=== Shadow Scale ===
Description: Shadow Scales are a crafting material dropped from the Eater of Worlds. They can be used in conjunction with Demonite Bars to create Demonite tools and the Shadow armor set. A total of 121 / 56 Shadow Scales are required to craft one of each item.

The Finch Staff is a starting item for Journey Mode characters, and can be found in Living Wood Chests within Living Trees in all modes. While the Baby Finch buff is active, a nest appears on the player's head, in which the Baby Finch will rest when not attacking. When multiple Baby Finches are summoned, they will all be visible on the player's head. Unlike most other summon weapons, its best possible modifier is Mythical because both the Mythical and Ruthless modifiers only raise its base damage to 8 due to rounding.

=== Molten Fury ===
Description: The Molten Fury is a pre-Hardmode bow that lights ordinary Wooden Arrows ablaze, effectively transforming them into Flaming Arrows, and causing them to emit light and inflict the On Fire! debuff to enemies it hits. Other arrow types fired from Molten Fury will retain their original properties. Wooden Arrows do not inherit the increased damage of actual Flaming Arrows. However, they do have a 33.33*1/3 (33.33%) chance to drop as one rather than a Wooden Arrow when they hit an enemy. On the PC version, Console version, Mobile version, Old Chinese version, tModLoader version, and tModLoader 1.3-Legacy version, the Molten Fury has the highest base damage of all bows available prior to Hardmode.

Up to 15 Life Crystals can be used per player, increasing health capacity by 300 (15 hearts). Added to the 100 health new players begin with (5 hearts), a total of 400 health (20 hearts) can be achieved. Additional Life Crystals can no longer be used at that point, and attempting to do so will not consume the item. Life Crystals can be found naturally placed in any area in the Underground layer and below, though they are fairly uncommon. They cannot be found in The Underworld or the Dungeon, unless on Old-gen console. They also have a 6.67*1/15 (6.67%) chance of dropping from a Golden or Titanium Crate. After a world converts to Hardmode, and after the 400 health maximum is reached from consuming Life Crystals, Life Fruits can be used to increase health capacity further, to a maximum of 500 (20 Life Fruits).

Up to 8 projectiles can stick to an enemy at once, with each dealing 25 damage per quarter-second. 8 spears × 25 damage = 200 max base spear damage per quarter-second = 800 max spear DPS. When a spear expires or hits a block, it will explode, dealing damage in an area. The spears also emit a good amount of light, making exploration and finding enemies in the dark much easier.

It however cannot be used for recipes that require Any Wood. Cacti, Gem trees, and Giant Glowing Mushrooms display some Wood-like properties, especially in the sense that they are gathered from background plants cut with an axe. Cactus and Glowing Mushroom cannot be used in recipes calling for Any Wood, however they do have recipes for furniture, tools, and weapons much like those of normal Wood. Gem trees, while having tree-like properties, drop stone and their respective gem. Some Wood types are found placed in other forms. For example, Underground Cabins generally use Wood corresponding to their biome (i.e. Rich Mahogany in the Jungle, Boreal in the Snow biome, normal Wood basically everywhere else). Living Trees and Living Mahogany Trees are made of Living Wood and Rich Mahogany, respectively.

=== Demon Heart ===
Description: The Demon Heart is an Expert Mode consumable item obtained from the Wall of Flesh's Treasure Bag. It permanently grants the player an extra accessory slot, for use only within Expert and Master worlds. This effect does not stack and may only be used once per player. If a player opens the Wall of Flesh's Treasure Bag after they have already consumed a Demon Heart, another one will not be obtained.[1] When a player who consumed a Demon Heart is in a Classic Mode world (a non-Expert/Master world), the extra accessory slot is disabled, removing all functional or display effects from any items equipped in the slot, and darkening the slot itself. Players in Classic worlds are also prevented from equipping items in the sixth or seventh slot, though an equipped item in the slot may still be taken out, and placed back into the Inventory.


=== Orange Zapinator ===
Description: The Orange Zapinator is a Hardmode Magic weapon purchased from the Traveling Merchant for 50. Unlike the Zapinator, the Orange Zapinator does not autofire. Meteor armor's set bonus will reduce the mana cost of the Orange Zapinator (and Gray Zapinator) to 0, although the stated mana cost will not change. This content is transcluded from Gray Zapinator.The weapon fires a laser beam which behaves very erratically. Upon striking an enemy, the projectile slows down by 40%, decreases its current damage and knockback by 10%, and can choose from an assortment of special effects as described below. The laser beam will disappear after hitting eight enemies or after 60 seconds. Its best modifier is Mythical.

While it is possible for a projectile to trigger all of them at once upon hitting an enemy, it is also possible that none of them are triggered.


=== Bubble ===
Description: Bubbles are animated background furniture blocks, which have special behavior regarding liquids, interacting as if the bubble was a solid block. When bubbles are placed together in groups, they connect to make a larger bubble or more complex structures. Bubbles are purchased from the Party Girl for 2 each, after the world enters Hardmode. Grates function as the opposite of bubbles, acting as solid blocks but allowing liquids to flow through. The only blocks that can be attached to placed bubbles are other bubbles (unless there is a background wall present). Bubbles cannot be hammered into half-blocks, and are thus unable to produce Waterfalls. Actuators do not affect bubbles. Liquids will collide with bubbles as if they were solid blocks. Structures made of bubbles can be used to contain liquids just like blocks. Bubbles can also keep liquids "inside" them, just as solid blocks can trap liquids they were placed over. The liquid cannot be seen inside the bubble, so empty bubbles and filled bubbles appear the same, however it can be interacted with:


=== Magiluminescence ===
Description: The Magiluminescence is an accessory that increases the player's movement speed by 20%, as well as doubling acceleration and deceleration. This movement speed increase is unique in that it stacks with Hermes Boots and its variants.[1] It also creates an aura of light around the player, which can be useful when exploring underground.

=== Featherfall Potion ===
Description: The Featherfall Potion is a buff potion which grants the Featherfall buff when consumed. The buff reduces the player's fall speed and gravity by 1/3, allowing them to jump higher than normal. This lasts for 10 minutes / 5 minutes, but can be canceled at any time by right-clicking the icon ( ), by selecting the icon and canceling it in the equipment menu ( ), by double-tapping the buff icon ( ), or by canceling the buff from the buffs screen (). The player can hold the ▼ Down key to cancel the effects or the ▲ Up key to further reduce fall speed and gravity to 90%. While under the effects of both Featherfall Potion and Gravitation Potion, holding the ▲ Up key will make the player fall up at normal speed. The player will fall up at a slowed speed when holding no direction. The effects of the Featherfall Potion can also be used to jump higher. By holding ▲ Up, grappling a platform above you, and releasing the grapple before it is complete, one may achieve jumping heights of several hundred blocks. Fall damage is also negated, even when falling normally. It is worth noting that the Featherfall Potion also increases the distance players are knocked back when hit by an attack.

Once crafted, the bowled Pupfish cannot be released again, and when placed down it moves around inside the bowl as it would do outside. Unlike many critters, Pupfish are capable of spawning on-screen.

When the player is far enough away, a balloon will carry the Baby Grinch to catch up to the player.


=== Paper Airplanes ===
Description: The Paper Airplane and White Paper Airplane are consumable ranged weapons. When thrown, they will travel in a different path each time, as they are affected by wind speed and direction. This is especially apparent on a Windy Day. They are sometimes dropped by slimes that are carried by Windy Balloons, which can spawn during a Windy Day. Unlike other consumable ranged weapons, Paper Airplanes always drop as an item when flying for too long, hitting a block, or hitting an enemy. Due to their extremely low damage and rarity, they are not really a practical weapon, more a novelty item similar to the kites.


=== Tax Collector's set ===
Description: The Tax Collector's set is a Hardmode vanity set consisting of the Tax Collector's Hat, the Tax Collector's Suit and the Tax Collector's Pants. On the PC version, Console version, Mobile version, and tModLoader version, it is purchased from the Clothier for 9 (set) when the Tax Collector is present in the world.

It boosts jump height by 33% and jump speed by 30%, increasing the player's first jump's height to ~10.5 blocks (~75% increase), and provides a double jump that goes to 18.5 blocks, for a total of 29 blocks. Unlike most other double-jump balloons, the Fart in a Balloon's full jump is high enough for the player to take minor fall damage, unless the player has fall damage immunity accessories like the Lucky Horseshoe. The jump also makes a gassy fart sound.

=== 1.3.0.1 ===
Description: 1.3.0.1 "Terraria 1.3" Release date June 30, 2015 [1] Version chronology ← Previous Next → 1.2.4.1 1.3.0.2 Version history • All patches The 1.3.0.1 update, commonly referred to as 1.3, adds a large quantity of new items and characters, major new bosses and events, the brand new Expert world mode, and many significant changes to the game's mechanics and interface. A large number of the game's existing elements have also been adjusted for balance and gameflow. 1.3 was designed with the intention of being "better", rather than simply larger with an inflated item count – however, it does include over 800 new items, most of which have been omitted from the official changelog for players to discover. A large amount of bugs have been fixed from prior releases - and even more related to 1.3 itself. This is a partial list. And much, much more...


=== Super Mana Potion ===
Description: The Super Mana Potion is a potion that restores 300 mana and gives the Mana Sickness debuff upon use.

=== Pumps ===
Description: Inlet and Outlet Pumps are mechanisms used to transport liquids (water, lava, honey, and shimmer), without having to construct pathways through blocks or rely on gravity. Instead, an Inlet and Outlet Pump need only be connected to each other with Wires and activated, which transfers fluid from the Inlet to the Outlet. Each activation transfers up to four tiles of liquid. For continuous automated pumping, a timer can be used. Despite its appearance as a pipe that takes in liquid from beside it, an Inlet Pump must be submerged in liquid, as it removes liquid that lies directly over its graphic, and does so equally from all of its 2×2 tile space. Similarly, an Outlet Pump spawns liquid directly over its graphic, and does so equally over all of its 2×2 tile space.

=== Dirt Rod ===
Description: The Dirt Rod is a unique tool that is used solely to move Dirt Blocks around, and is unlike the use of ordinary mining tools and block placement. When used while the cursor is over a Dirt Block, the block becomes a dirt ball that sticks to the cursor as long as the ⚒ Use / Attack key is held down. The dirt ball can be carried through blocks and relocated anywhere on the screen. When released, the dirt ball is affected by gravity and also continues to carry the speed it was being moved at previously, allowing it to be "thrown". Upon impact with any blocks, a released dirt ball turns back into a solid Dirt Block. The Dirt Rod is purchased from the Dryad for 5 () / 20 ().


=== Tin Pickaxe ===
Description: The Tin Pickaxe is an early-game pickaxe that is weaker than the Iron and Lead Pickaxes. Compared to its alternate ore version, the Copper Pickaxe, it has the same pickaxe power, but deals 1 more damage, is slightly faster in terms of mining speed, and has a longer range by 1 tile. Like other low-tier pickaxes, it can only mine blocks and ores weaker than Meteorite (which requires a pickaxe with at least 50% pickaxe power, e.g. a Tungsten Pickaxe).

Like the Pwnhammer (and higher-tier hammers), it can also be used to destroy Altars, and shares its tooltip. Its best modifier is Legendary. While Light may seem to provide a better speed boost by percentages, rounding reveals that Legendary and Light mine at equal speeds for this tool.

Description: The Pearlwood Crate is a Hardmode crate that can be obtained by fishing in any biome, at any height. It is the lowest tier of standard crate, having the least value if sold directly. It is the Hardmode counterpart of the Wooden Crate. Note: Only one type of item out of all ores and bars can drop, not both a type of ore and a type of bar or any other combination of the four groups. The table above implies otherwise with the four groups being in separate rows, but that is for readability purposes. The chance that a type of ore or bar is dropped is 25*1/4 (25%).

=== Ice Blade ===
Description: The Ice Blade is a sword that is found in Frozen Chests in the Ice biome, Frozen Crates, and Boreal Crates. It fires an "icy bolt" projectile when swung, at no mana or ammunition cost. The projectile does the same amount of damage as the sword itself but has a cooldown of 55 frames, or about 0.9 seconds. The projectile also emits a small amount of light, which lingers briefly after it shatters. The light level is roughly on par with an Ice Torch. Its best modifier is Legendary.


=== Deathbringer Pickaxe ===
Description: The Deathbringer Pickaxe is a relatively early-game pickaxe. Its Corruption counterpart is the Nightmare Pickaxe. It has a faster mining speed by one and mines Crimstone/Dungeon Bricks/Ebonstone/Hellstone/Pearlstone Blocks in one less hit (3 instead of 4). The Deathbringer Pickaxe, Nightmare Pickaxe and Molten Pickaxe (and Reaver Shark on ) are the only pre-Hardmode pickaxes able to mine Crimstone, Ebonstone, and Hellstone. The Deathbringer Pickaxe can only mine Dungeon Bricks that are at 0 depth or higher. 100% Pickaxe power (a Molten Pickaxe or better) is required to mine Dungeon Bricks in the Underground Dungeon.

=== Queen Spider Staff ===
Description: The Queen Spider Staff is a Hardmode sentry summon weapon. It can summon the Spider Turret sentry, which lasts for 10 minutes / 2 minutes , remains stationary, and does not count against the player's minion capacity. The Spider Turret fires short-range spider eggs at enemies roughly once per second, which can bounce, roll, and are heavily affected by gravity. Upon colliding with enemies, the eggs break, dealing damage and spawning two baby spiders that attack enemies suicide-style, inflicting summon damage along with the Acid Venom debuff for 2–4 / 4–6 seconds before disappearing. The eggs will eventually break and spawn spiders even if they do not hit an enemy. If there are no enemies within range, the baby spiders will persist for several seconds before vanishing. The Spider Turret can be summoned in any area of the visible screen, even if blocks completely separate the player from the point chosen. It requires blocks or platforms to stand on. Its best modifier is Ruthless. The Mythical modifier provides the widest array of stat bonuses, but these primarily affect the initial summon rather than the resulting minion. Additionally, minions cannot deal critical hits. The only lasting advantage a Mythical Queen Spider Staff has over a Ruthless one is knockback.

=== Lava Charm ===
Description: The Lava Charm is an accessory that grants immunity to lava for 7 seconds. On the PC version, Console version, Mobile version, and tModLoader version, it can be obtained from Hellstone Crates and Obsidian Crates with a 5*1/20 (5%) chance, or in Chests in the lower portion of the Caverns where lava pools can naturally spawn. On the Old-gen console version, Windows Phone version, Old Chinese version, Nintendo 3DS version, and tModLoader 1.3-Legacy version it can only be found in Chests, but can be found throughout all of the Caverns. When the Lava Charm is equipped and the player comes into contact with lava, a 7-second countdown begins, signified by a lava meter that displays over the player's head, which operates similarly to the breath meter, but displays flame icons instead of bubbles. Lava immunity time is recharged gradually by exiting lava, the same way breathing time is recharged by exiting water (albeit much more slowly).

=== Pogo Stick ===
Description: The Pogo Stick is a mount sold by the Party Girl for 25. Jumping again while in the air causes the player to do a front-flip. It doubles the speed at which the player falls, but does not grant immunity to fall damage. It has a max speed of 28 mph. It also has a certain amount of momentum while airborne, meaning it continues travelling in the last horizontal direction the player inputted whist in the air, rather than slowing.


=== Cracked Dungeon Bricks ===
Description: Cracked Dungeon Bricks can be found in Dungeons, or can be crafted with Dungeon Bricks at a Heavy Work Bench. Crafted Cracked Dungeon Bricks behave the same as naturally generated Cracked Dungeon Bricks, and do not drop an item upon destruction. Cracked Dungeon Bricks behave similarly to Thin Ice and Sand, but with distinct differences from both. If jumped on, walked across, grappled to, or mined with a pickaxe, several Cracked Dungeon Bricks nearby the targeted tile, including the tile itself, may fall and be destroyed upon hitting solid ground, dropping no item. Unlike ordinary Dungeon Bricks, Cracked Dungeon Bricks can be mined with any pickaxe. Destroying the Cracked Dungeon Bricks naturally generated in the Dungeon may reveal hidden pathways to other parts of the Dungeon that are otherwise inaccessible without proper tools, and doing so is often required to access significant portions of the Dungeon if the player is unable to mine the Dungeon Bricks. Cracked Brick will break either if the player hits it with a pickaxe, directly grapples to the block, collides with it with enough speed, or damages them with a grenade, or with a 50% chance should a falling cracked brick hit a solid cracked brick. Each tick[1], the game will perform the following steps to break any nearby cracked bricks: All grenades in the game will destroy all cracked bricks within a ~8 block radius. This makes them, especially Sticky Grenades, ideal for removing large groups of cracked bricks. When a Cracked Dungeon Brick tile is destroyed, the 8 Cracked Dungeon Bricks around it have a 16.67*1/6 (16.67%) chance to break, except the tile directly above it, which has a 33.33*1/3 (33.33%) chance to be destroyed.

=== Shiverthorn ===
Description: Shiverthorn is a type of herb that grows naturally on snow and ice blocks of any type. It can be harvested with any weapon or tool, and can be planted manually with Shiverthorn Seeds, which can also be planted in Clay Pots and Planter Boxes. Shiverthorn will always bloom after a period of growth, and unlike other herbs, remain bloomed permanently thereafter. Fully grown Shiverthorn emits a glowing particle effect. Harvesting Shiverthorn while in bloom yields 1-3 Shiverthorn Seeds in addition to the Shiverthorn item. Both Shiverthorn and their respective seeds have a chance to be obtained from the Herb Bag.

=== Wire ===
Description: Wire is a unique item used to connect mechanisms. Generally a mechanism is connected to a triggering item, like a Pressure Plate, Timer, Switch or Lever. Wires are placed using Wrenches, and are retrieved using the Wire Cutter, both of which can only be obtained from the Mechanic. Wire placed by different colored wrenches will be of different colors, which allows independent wire paths to overlap without interfering with each other. Wire itself is available for purchase from the Mechanic for 5 each, but can also be obtained from naturally-occurring mechanisms, which exist sparsely Underground, and frequently in the Dungeon and Jungle Temple Traps and Chain Lantern/Switch arrangements. Wires occupy their own dedicated layer when placed, and so can occupy the same tile space as Furniture, Walls, Blocks, and even deep Lava pools, along with any other object. Wires can be placed in midair, without the need for support. Explosions have no effect on placed Wires. By default, placed Wires are invisible unless the player holds a Mechanism-related item as the tool in hand, (e.g, a Pressure Plate, Wrench, or even a stack of Wire itself). However, if the player is carrying a Mechanical Lens (or more usually its upgrade The Grand Design) they can not only see Wires at will, but can control the visibility of individual wire colors. As of 1.4.4 , wires in the Jungle Temple cannot be seen or destroyed until Golem is defeated for the first time. This makes exploring the temple and battling Golem for the first time a much harder task.Verify With Wrenches and Wire Cutters, the player's Wire placing and cutting reach is roughly 25 tiles horizontally and vertically. With The Grand Design, the player can place or cut Wire anywhere on the visible screen. Wires are considered "connected" to triggers and mechanisms when they are placed in the same tile space as those items (when they appear to be "touching"). An exception is Statues, which are considered connected to any wires in their 2x3 tile space, even though some statues do not appear to reach a 3-tile height (see adjacent image). Wire is considered "ammunition" for wrenches, and can therefore be placed in the Ammo slots of a player's inventory.

=== Hive Pack ===
Description: The Hive Pack is an Expert Mode accessory found in the Treasure Bag dropped by the Queen Bee. When equipped, half of all friendly bees created by the caster will appear as larger, more damaging versions. As opposed to a normal bee's potential 1 bonus damage, these more damaging bees can deal up to 1-4 extra damage, and fly noticeably faster. Stronger bees also deal 0.5 knockback (with a 1.1× multiplier), can pierce 3 enemies (instead of normal bees' 2), and last 11 seconds instead of 10. Note that since all sources of strong bees have 0 knockback, the multiplier is never effective. The Hive Pack will summon bees with increased damage for the following bee-related items: It also allows the Bee Gun, Bee Keeper, Honey Comb and its derivative accessories an extra 33% chance to summon an additional bee when used.

=== Shadewood ===
Description: Shadewood is the Crimson replacement for normal wood. It works the same exact way as normal wood but has a blue-gray tint. Shadewood can be acquired by chopping down trees that have been afflicted by the Crimson. Shadewood has better attributes than items crafted from normal wood (example: normal Wooden Sword does 7 damage while a Shadewood Sword does 11 damage). Shadewood is the second best wood for crafting equipment (tools and weapons), but is the third best for the variants of wood armors, only being beaten by Pearlwood and Spooky Wood; as it has higher damage, defense and tool power than most other woods. Palm trees that have grown on Crimsand will give Shadewood instead of Palm Wood, as there is no Crimson variant of Palm Wood. Shadewood, along with Ebonwood, is the best wood for tools, weapons, and armor, before entering Hardmode. A good tactic for procuring Shadewood early on is to use your axe as a weapon as well as a tool. While chopping trees, face the direction of any approaching threats. Early-game axes have arguably impressive knockback, making it a great option for a multitasking tool to fend off enemies and get Shadewood simultaneously. Shadewood cannot spread the Crimson. Shadewood (other than texture) is exactly the same as Ebonwood.

Similar to Meteor Shots, the individual bees can each pierce one enemy or ricochet off a solid block once, but not both. Its best modifier is Unreal.


=== Wooden Hammer ===
Description: The Wooden Hammer is the lowest tier of hammer available, just below the Copper Hammer.

Its best modifier is Light for harvesting purposes and either Agile or Forceful/Strong for combat purposes, due to its unusually low base damage.

Description: The Molten Hamaxe is a tool which functions as both a hammer and an axe, and is an upgrade from the Meteor Hamaxe. It is crafted solely using Hellstone Bars. This tool has a chance of inflicting the On Fire! debuff. Its hammer and axe powers are the highest of all pre-Hardmode tools. While it has more axe power than most Hardmode axes, it is hindered in usage by its comparatively slow tool speed, making many later tools a better choice. Its best modifier is Legendary. While Light may seem to provide a better speed boost by percentages, rounding reveals that Legendary and Light mine at equal speeds for this tool.

Description: The Tsunami in a Bottle is an Accessory found in Wooden, Iron, Pearlwood, and Mythril Crates. It gives the player a double jump ability, similar to other Bottle Accessories. The Tsunami in a Bottle's double jump height is marginally greater than that of the Cloud in a Bottle, but does not reach as high as the Blizzard in a Bottle, Fart in a Jar, or Sandstorm in a Bottle. The Tsunami in a Bottle also visually replaces the effect upon double jumping with a burst of water. Reaching two blocks further than the Cloud in a Bottle, the Tsunami in a Bottle comes just one block short of the Blizzard in a Bottle's maximum jump height, yet lacks the speed boost function that blizzard and those greater than it share.

Its best modifier is Ruthless. The Mythical modifier provides the widest array of stat bonuses, but these primarily affect the initial summon rather than the resulting minion.

=== Wormhole Potion ===
Description: The Wormhole Potion is a potion which allows a player to instantly teleport to another team member's location in multiplayer, by selecting their player icon in the full-screen map (accessible by pressing the Toggle Full Map key). It is only possible to teleport to players of the same team, and the teleport will be announced in a status message. It is not possible to use Wormhole Potions if the player has the minimap disabled. Wormhole Potions can drop from Pots and slimes, but only in multiplayer. Note that other players do not have to be online for the potion to drop, so just selecting multiplayer and hosting the game can allow collecting the potions. Wormhole Potions can be crafted in a singleplayer world as well. It has a small chance to appear as a bonus drop from Slimes. In 1.4.4 the recipe changed to 3 bottled water instead of 1, effectively tripling the number of Wormhole Potions crafted.

=== Bottled Water ===
Description: Bottled Water is a recovery potion and crafting material crafted at a sink or a body of water. Crafting it does not lower the water level and it cannot be emptied on a block like a Water Bucket. Bottled Water heals the player for 20 health instantly when used, which – like any other healing potion – triggers the Potion Sickness debuff. The Bottled Water serves as the basis of almost every craftable Potion in the game, and is also necessary for the creation of Flasks, cosmetic jars like Jellyfish Jars, and Thrown Water. It is thus an essential crafting material.

Description: A Penguin is a passive critter. It only spawns in the Snow Biome and may spawn with different colors. The Penguin behaves as the other normal ground critters: it wanders around randomly as any other critter would, and it can easily be killed by enemies. It can be caught with any Bug Net to be carried around in the inventory and released later, or crafted into a Penguin Cage to be used as decorative furniture. Once crafted, the caged Penguin cannot be released again, and when placed down it moves around inside the cage as it would do outside. The Penguin Cage occupies a 6x3 space. The Penguin inside may follow the following patterns randomly: Penguins become Corrupt Penguins or Vicious Penguins during a Blood Moon and will try to attack the player just like the other enemies. They can also be turned into their Corruption/Crimson variants with Vile Powder or Vicious Powder. They cannot be caught with a Bug Net in this state. The Bestiary entry for the Penguin: "Penguins make their home in the coldest regions of the world, waddling around looking for tasty fish."

Furthermore, Jungle armor and Ancient Cobalt armor pieces can be mixed and matched while still providing their set bonus.

Seaside Crates contain items found in standard crates, and always contain one item normally found in Water Chests. Its pre-Hardmode counterpart is the Ocean Crate. Note: Only one type of ore and one type of bar can drop, not both a pre-Hardmode type of ore and a Hardmode type of ore, or both a pre-Hardmode type of bar and a Hardmode type of bar. The table above implies otherwise with the respective groups being in separate rows, but that is for readability purposes. The chance that a type of ore is dropped is 14.29*1/7 (14.29%), and the chance that a type of bar is dropped is 25*1/4 (25%).

It turns any type of arrow into special Shadowflame Arrows, which inflict the Shadowflame debuff on hit. The Shadowflame Arrows fired will fly relatively slowly, but have an extremely high arc compared to most arrows, and may seem at first to be unaffected by gravity at all. If fired directly upwards, Shadowflame Arrows can travel 250 tiles skyward before beginning their descent, taking approximately 12 seconds from firing to fall back down to the player's position. They pierce up to two enemies, dissipating on the third hit. Its best modifier is Unreal.


=== North Pole ===

Additionally, the icy spear leaves behind a trail of damaging snowflakes which fall downwards and dissipate upon contact with an enemy or surface. The North Pole's spear projectile inflicts 85% of the weapon's base knockback (5.695 (Average)), while snowflakes inflict 46.75% of its base knockback (3.132 (Weak)). However, the weapon's damage values differ depending on the version. The North Pole is dropped by the Ice Queen during the Frost Moon event with a 4.44% ~ 7.78% (15.56% ~ 31.11%) chance depending on the current wave.[5] Its best modifier is Godly or Demonic.

=== Silly Balloons ===
Description: Silly Balloons are novelty blocks that can be purchased during a Party from the Party Girl for 1 each. When a single one is placed, it has a round appearance, just like Bubbles and Smoke Blocks. When balloons of the same color are placed together in groups, they connect to make a seemingly single larger balloon block. If placed adjacent to balloon blocks of other colors, they do not connect, and each will remain a single round balloon. In a similar way to Pink Slime Blocks, landing on any balloon block causes the player to bounce.

The projectile disappears after piercing four enemies (hitting the fifth one) or after ricocheting four times (hitting a block for the fifth time). The Meowmere has a 22.22*2/9 (22.22%) / 11.11*1/9 (11.11%) chance to be dropped by the Moon Lord. Its best modifier is Legendary.

=== Hallowed Grass Wall ===
Description: Hallowed Grass Wall is a type of wall. Like the grass of the Hallow, it has a notable hue of cyan and often features small flowers. On the PC version, Console version, Mobile version, and tModLoader version, it is sold by the Dryad during a Blood Moon. In all other versions, it can be destroyed, but not harvested, making it unobtainable as an item. Hallowed Grass Wall cannot be created by the player on the Old-gen console version, Windows Phone version, Old Chinese version, Nintendo 3DS version, and tModLoader 1.3-Legacy version the way most other walls can, but it can be converted from Grass Wall, Flower Wall, and Jungle Wall (both natural ones and those bought from the Dryad) by using Blue Solution sprayed with the Clentaminator. As the Clentaminator affects a rather large area, creating areas of localized Hallowed Grass Walls without converting blocks and other wall parts may be difficult. Hallowed Grass Walls can spread The Hallow to nearby pure walls. See Biome spread for further information.


=== Scourge of the Corruptor ===
Description: The Scourge of the Corruptor is a Hardmode post-Plantera weapon that fires projectiles. It is always found inside the Dungeon's Corruption Chest in Corruption worlds (Crimson worlds will not have one but will instead have a Crimson Chest containing Vampire Knives). A Corruption Key is needed to open the Corruption Chest. The Scourge of the Corruptor fires an Eater's Bite, a fast javelin head that looks like a small Eater of Souls, then splits into 2–4 / 2–5 Tiny Eaters upon impact with a solid block or enemy. These smaller projectiles have homing capabilities, can travel approximately 700 feet, and ricochet up to 5 times before dissipating. Both the Eater's Bite and Tiny Eaters are unaffected by gravity. The Scourge of the Corruptor is a melee weapon and benefits from armor and accessories that provide melee bonuses, such as Turtle armor or Beetle armor and the Fire Gauntlet, as well as the effects of flasks. Its best modifier is Godly or Demonic. Both modifiers increase the average damage output by the same amount.


=== Spider Egg ===
Description: The Spider Egg summons the spider Pet. It behaves exactly like the Spider AI, as it will crawl on Walls if there are any. When the player jumps high enough or outruns the spider, it will ride on a white spiderweb, as if it were standing on a wall, to keep up with the player. The Spider Egg is dropped by Pumpking during the Pumpkin Moon event.


=== Firework Fountain ===
Description: The Firework Fountain is a placed novelty mechanism that, when activated, produces one of four colorful "sparkle fountain" effects. Once placed, the Fountain can be activated via wire, or by right-clicking the Fountain directly. Its effect is purely visual, causes no damage, and can be used infinitely at no cost. It is purchased from the Party Girl for 3.


=== Luminite Arrow ===
Description: Luminite Arrows are one of the strongest types of arrows. When fired, they are followed by a laser-like projectile after a short delay.

Description: The Rifle Scope is a Hardmode, post-Plantera accessory. It grants the ability to increase view range while holding a gun by pressing and holding ⚷ Interact and moving the cursor. The Rifle Scope has a 8.33*1/12 (8.33%) / 15.97*23/144 (15.97%) chance to drop from Skeleton Snipers in the post-Plantera Dungeon.

Description: The Bubble Machine is a novelty furniture mechanism purchased from the Party Girl for 4 during the day / at any time. When placed, it continuously produces bubbles. These bubbles are purely visual, have no functional effect, and can be produced infinitely at no cost. Each bubble is of a random size, and a random one of four possible colors: Pink, purple, green, or blue. With no obstacles in the way, bubbles last for random durations. They will pop on contact with characters or foreground blocks. It can be activated and deactivated via wire, but is always on by default when first placed.


=== Vampire Frog Staff ===
Description: The Vampire Frog Staff is a pre-Hardmode summon weapon. It spawns a Vampire Frog minion that follows the player and attacks enemies using its tongue. Like other minions, the summoned Vampire Frog is invincible and follows the player for an unlimited amount of time, unless the player dies, summons a replacement minion, cancels the buff, or leaves the world. It has a 12.5*1/8 (12.5%) chance to be dropped by a Zombie Merman or Wandering Eye Fish, both of which will spawn while fishing during a Blood Moon. The best modifier is Mythical but Godly, Demonic, Ruthless, Furious, and Masterful all raise its base damage by the same amount due to rounding.


=== Bloody Machete ===
Description: The Bloody Machete is a rare and unique boomerang-type weapon that can drop only during the Halloween seasonal event. When thrown, as it falls downward after reaching a maximum range, and returns to the thrower upon impacting a block or enemy. Its physics are similar to the Magic Dagger, but it must return to the player before being thrown again. Its best modifier is Godly or Demonic. Both modifiers increase the average damage output by the same amount. The Bloody Machete has a 0.05*1/2000 (0.05%) chance of being dropped by any weak enemy during the Halloween seasonal event. Weak enemies are enemies with less than 20 defense, 40 damage and up to 5 of loot. These will be mostly pre hardmode enemies. When playing in expert mode all enemies are much stronger and therefore these conditions limit the amount of enemies that can drop the Bloody Machete and Bladed Glove to just a couple, especially during hardmode. See the table below for clarification.


=== Bottomless Lava Bucket ===
Description: The Bottomless Lava Bucket is an item that functions similarly to the standard Lava Bucket, except that it never runs out of Lava and can place it slightly faster than a regular lava bucket (especially when moving the cursor around while filling). It is obtained as a rare drop from fishing in lava. It is the lava counterpart of the Bottomless Water Bucket.


=== Shadow Key ===
Description: The Shadow Key is an item used solely to open Shadow Chests (found in the Underworld) and Obsidian Lock Boxes (found inside Obsidian and Hellstone Crates). It does not stack and is not consumed upon use; one Shadow Key can be used to open unlimited Shadow Chests. On the Nintendo 3DS version, a Shadow Key has a 75% chance to drop from Arch Wyverns. On every other platform, the first Shadow Key in a world can only be obtained from the Dungeon inside (Golden Chests, Water Chests or Biome Chests). Subsequent Shadow Keys can sometimes be found locked inside Golden Lock Boxes, which come from Dungeon and Stockade Crates (both must be fished from the Dungeon).


=== Ichor Dart ===
Description: Ichor Darts are a type of dart used with the Blowgun, Blowpipe, Dart Pistol, and Dart Rifle. They inflict the Ichor debuff on enemies and pierce while ignoring enemy immunity frames before splitting into 2–5 non-piercing darts shortly after traveling. They can be crafted from Ichor by hand. They are the Crimson's counterpart to the Corruption's Cursed Darts.

It also gives off blue particles when swung, which generate very faint light. Its best modifier is Legendary.


=== Dart Pistol ===
Description: The Dart Pistol is a Hardmode ranged weapon that consumes darts as ammunition. It has a 20*1/5 (20%) chance to be dropped by the Crimson Mimic. It is the Crimson counterpart to the Corruption's Dart Rifle. Its best modifier is Unreal.

On the Old Chinese version and tModLoader 1.3-Legacy version, it is obtained by killing the Martian Saucer (1/9 chance). The Anti-Gravity Hook launches 3 hooks which reach 31.25 tiles at maximum. When any hook latches onto a block, the player will be pushed 12 blocks away from the latch point if there is room to do so. While latched to a block, the player can use the movement keys to orbit around the latch point, or reposition themselves if they are caught between two or three latch points; however, they will return to the farthest point when they let go of the movement keys.


=== Paladin's Hammer ===
Description: Paladin's Hammer is a Hardmode, post-Plantera boomerang with high velocity and knockback but low range. It has a 6.67*1/15 (6.67%) / 9.78*22/225 (9.78%) chance to be dropped from Paladins in post-Plantera Dungeon areas with Brick background walls. Its best modifier is Godly or Demonic. Both modifiers increase the average damage output by the same amount.


=== Blowgun ===
Description: The Blowgun is a pre-Hardmode ranged weapon, a stronger version of the Blowpipe, and is purchased from the Witch Doctor for 5. It looks similar to the Blowpipe, but has a red ribbon on the top and is flared on one end and is used by the Witch Doctor to defend himself. It can shoot Seeds, Poison Darts, Cursed Darts, Ichor Darts and Crystal Darts. Carrying a Blowgun in the inventory causes any vegetation growing on normal grass blocks to occasionally yield some Seeds when destroyed. Flowers growing in Clay Pots and Planter Boxes can also yield Seeds. Both wild and cultivated flowers typically drop 4 Seeds at a time. Long grass typically drops 1-2 Seeds. Its best modifier is Unreal.


=== Gravedigger's Shovel ===
Description: The Gravedigger's Shovel is a tool that can be used to dig up "soft" blocks (see below) more efficiently than a pickaxe or drill, in a 3×3 tile square centered on the cursor. It takes 2 swings to dig up each "soft" block, and all blocks are mined at the same time. Its best modifier is Legendary. While Light may seem to provide a better speed boost by percentages, rounding reveals that Legendary and Light mine at equal speeds for this tool.

Its best modifier is Mythical. The Water Bolt is hidden amongst the Books on shelves in the Dungeon, below the vertical center of the Underground layer.[1] Despite its red appearance in an inventory slot, the Water Bolt is always the blue book with a yellow band on it when on shelves. Since a careful visual inspection is not always practical in the Dungeon due to frequent enemy attacks, any of the following methods can also be used to locate the Water Bolt: If the player is standing too far away, tooltips will not show, nor will right-clicks cause the Water Bolt to drop. The proximity required is the same as for opening Chests or speaking to NPCs.


=== Jungle Crate ===

The location of the cursor must be unoccupied in order to form an Ice Block. If the tile is occupied either by blocks or background objects, the fired Ice Block acts as an ordinary projectile, flying in a straight line and unaffected by gravity, and shatters when it hits an enemy or other foreground objects. If the cursor is on an existing Ice Block from a previous casting, it will cause the next projectile to pass through the existing Ice Block. Regular blocks can be placed adjacent to the created Ice Blocks, which can prove useful in building floating structures (especially at higher elevations such as in Space), as it is not necessary to build a temporary connection from the ground or a Floating Island to the building site. Its best modifier is Mythical.

When wired to Dart Traps, for example, activating the Lever will always cause the trap to shoot, the same as a Pressure Plate would, no matter which position the Lever happens to be in.

=== Tempest Staff ===
Description: The Tempest Staff is a Hardmode summon weapon. It spawns a small Sharknado minion that follows the player for an unlimited amount of time, and attacks enemies automatically by firing Mini Sharkron projectiles which splatter against enemies and blocks. Its attack is akin to a miniature version of Duke Fishron's tornado/shark attack. The Tempest Staff has a 20% chance of being dropped by Duke Fishron. The Tempest Staff's tornado moves to intercept enemies at significant range, and can pass through blocks. The tornado itself also damages enemies on contact. Its best modifier is Ruthless. The Mythical modifier provides the widest array of stat bonuses, but these primarily affect the initial summon rather than the resulting minion. Additionally, minions cannot deal critical hits. The only lasting advantage a Mythical Tempest Staff has over a Ruthless one is knockback.


=== Zapinator ===
Description: The Zapinator is a 3DS-exclusive,[1] Hardmode magic weapon. It has an approximate 1.25*1/80 (1.25%) chance of being dropped by Plantera, but the exact drop chance is unknown. It shoots green projectiles very rapidly. It can be considered as an upgrade to the Space Gun. Its best modifier is either Masterful for mana conservation or Godly/Demonic for higher damage output. It cannot get the Mythical modifier due to its low mana cost.


=== Grate ===
Description: Grates are foreground blocks which allow liquids to fall through while remaining solid for everything else, acting like a drainage system. Grates can be toggled open and closed when triggered via wire. An open Grate is transparent, allowing light and liquid through, while a closed Grate is opaque and acts as a solid block. If a Grate is triggered while liquid is passing through it, the Grate holds the liquid until it is opened again or the liquid is removed by a player, e.g. via the use of an Empty Bucket, Super Absorbant Sponge, Dry Bomb or Dry Rocket. Bubbles function as the opposite of Grates, acting as background objects which prevent the flow of liquids through them but allow through other things like players. Grates are not destroyed when dropped in lava, despite having a rarity of 00*.

While under the influence of a Flask of Ichor, melee and whip attacks will inflict the Ichor Debuff[1] for 10 to 19 seconds, decreasing the defense of enemies by 15 / 20, therefore increasing the damage of the player's weapon by 7-8 / 10. It will make the weapon glow when swung. If used with yoyos, it can be a good lighting source in dark areas. This item does not apply the debuff in PvP scenarios.

=== Magma Skull ===
Description: The Magma Skull is a pre-Hardmode accessory crafted from a Lava Charm and an Obsidian Skull, combining the effects of both items. It can also be worn in a Social Accessory Slot as a vanity head item. When the Magma Skull is equipped and the player comes into contact with lava, a 7-second countdown begins, signified by a lava meter that displays over the player's head. It operates similarly to the Breath meter, but displays flame icons instead of bubbles. Lava immunity time is recharged gradually by exiting lava, the same way breathing time is recharged by exiting water (albeit much more slowly). The Magma Skull also grants immunity to the burning damage normally inflicted by contact with Meteorite, Hellstone, and Hellstone Brick. It does not grant immunity to other fire-based damage. The Magma Skull and the Molten Charm provide functionally identical effects, but are used to craft different items. The Magma Skull can be combined with an Obsidian Rose or Obsidian Skull Rose to craft the Molten Skull Rose.

The Enchanted Sword can be obtained by destroying an "enchanted sword in stone" background object, which can be found in random locations underground and in Enchanted Sword Shrines. Destroying this background object has a 98*49/50 (98%) / 90*9/10 (90%) / 100% chance to drop an Enchanted Sword. On the PC version, Console version, Mobile version, and tModLoader version, the Enchanted Sword also has a 2*1/50 (2%) chance to be found in Golden and Titanium Crates.

=== Titanium Drill ===
Description: The Titanium Drill is a Hardmode drill, and is the drill alternative to the Titanium Pickaxe. Appearances and sounds aside, the two tools are nearly functionally identical. The drill, however, is half a second faster. But, unlike pickaxes, most drills cannot be reforged with size, speed, or knockback modifiers. It can mine all blocks except Chlorophyte Ore and Lihzahrd Bricks. Its best modifier is Demonic, as it does not have any knockback and thus cannot get modifiers that affect it, and furthermore cannot get modifiers that affect its speed, either.

=== Raven Staff ===
Description: The Raven Staff is a Hardmode, post-Plantera summon weapon. It spawns a Raven minion that chases enemies and deals contact damage. Like other minions, the summoned Ravens is invincible and follows the player for an unlimited amount of time, unless the player dies, summons a replacement minion, cancels the buff, or leaves the world. It is dropped from Pumpking during the Pumpkin Moon event with a chance of 1.79% – 14.29%, depending on the wave. Its best modifier is Ruthless. The Mythical modifier provides the widest array of stat bonuses, but these primarily affect the initial summon rather than the resulting minion. Additionally, minions cannot deal critical hits. The only lasting advantage a Mythical Raven Staff has over a Ruthless one is knockback.


=== Pin Wheel ===
Description: The Pin Wheel is a novelty furniture. When placed, the wheel spins if it is windy, with its spin speed depending on the current wind speed in the area. It is purchased from the Merchant for 20 during the Windy Day event.


=== Fez ===

=== Shadow Orb (item) ===
Description: The Shadow Orb is a light pet item that summons a slow-moving Shadow Orb which follows the player around and emits dim, purple light. The orb can move through solid objects and liquids unhindered, but moves very slowly, causing it to fall behind when the player is moving quickly. If it falls far enough behind, it will teleport to the player's location. It has a 20*1/5 (20%) chance of dropping from destroyed Shadow Orbs, but it can also be acquired by looting Corrupt Crates, which are obtained by fishing in the Corruption. The Crimson counterpart to the Shadow Orb is the Crimson Heart.


=== Mythril Ore ===
Description: Mythril Ore is a Hardmode ore that appears in the world every two out of three Demon Altars or Crimson Altars that have been destroyed. Note that its equivalent, Orichalcum Ore, may spawn instead. Mythril Ore is found throughout the Cavern layer as well as in most Hardmode Crates. It requires a pickaxe power of 110 to mine (Cobalt/Palladium pickaxe or better, or any drill). To craft all Mythril equipment, a total of 155 Bars (or 620 Ore) is required.

=== Laser Rifle ===
Description: The Laser Rifle is a Hardmode magic weapon that auto-fires violet lasers which penetrate up to two enemies and emit moderate light. It has a 12.5*1/8 (12.5%) / 25*1/4 (25%) chance to be dropped by the Wall of Flesh. Despite its name, it does not count as a gun, cannot receive ranged weapon modifiers, and will not fulfill the requirements for the Arms Dealer to move in. The Laser Rifle can be considered an upgrade of the Space Gun, although the set bonus effect of Meteor armor does not apply to it. Its best modifier is Mythical.

=== Ballista sentry summons ===
Description: The Ballista Rod, Cane, and Staff are special sentry summon weapons. They can summon the Ballista sentry, which lasts for 10 minutes / 2 minutes , remains stationary, and does not count against the player's minion capacity. Each Ballista sentry is a large automated crossbow device on the ground that fires piercing spears at approaching enemies. The Rod is sold by the Tavernkeep for 50000*5 , the Cane for 150000*15 , and Staff for 600000*60 . The Rod is always available. The Cane becomes available after defeating one Mechanical Boss, and the Staff becomes available after defeating Golem. The three different versions cause an identical effect, but with varying statistics, with the Staff being the most expensive and the most powerful. These weapons can only be used outside of the Old One's Army event after the event has been successfully completed. Completing the event on any difficulty allows Rods, Canes, and Staves alike to be used outside of the event. During the Old One's Army event, Etherian Mana can be collected, which allows the placement of multiple Ballistas that remain permanently until the event is over. Etherian Mana cannot be used outside the event. Ballista sentries are boosted by the Squire armor and Valhalla Knight armor set bonuses, which increase the velocity of the ballista projectiles, increase penetration from 4 to 7, and grant Ballista Panic! when the player takes damage. Ballista Panic! doubles the fire rate of Ballista sentries for 5 seconds after taking damage. Additionally, the Valhalla Knight armor increases the firing rate from every 3 seconds to every 1.66 seconds. Its best modifier is Ruthless. The Mythical modifier presents a wider array of stat bonuses, but most of these apply to the initial summoning, and not to the resulting Ballista. Additionally, minions cannot deal critical hits. The only significant advantage the Mythical modifier has over Ruthless is in knockback.

If used while moving on a flying mount, its pages spread out. Its best modifier is Mythical.


=== Bomb Fish ===
Description: Bomb Fish are explosives obtained through fishing. They act as Sticky Bombs, sticking to any blocks that they are thrown at.


=== Spider Staff ===
Description: The Spider Staff is a Hardmode summon weapon. It spawns a spider minion that follows the player and attacks by latching on to enemies. If enough of them attack the same enemy, it can be stun-locked. The spiders inflict the Acid Venom debuff for 2-4 seconds, can climb background walls, and jump high. Like other minions, the summoned Spider is invincible and follows the player for an unlimited amount of time, unless the player dies, summons a replacement minion, cancels the buff, or leaves the world. Its best modifier is Ruthless. The Mythical modifier provides the widest array of stat bonuses, but these primarily affect the initial summon rather than the resulting minion. Additionally, minions cannot deal critical hits. The only lasting advantage a Mythical Spider Staff has over a Ruthless one is knockback. Interestingly, the Ruthless modifier on the spider staff grants it +19% damage, rather than +18% damage.

=== Flower Boots ===
Description: Flower Boots are a rare accessory which cause flowers to grow when the player walks on regular, Jungle, and Hallowed grass. These flowers are functionally the same as the tall weeds that grow naturally on grass, and drop Seeds and Hay normally. On the PC version, Console version, Mobile version, and tModLoader version, wearing Flower Boots drastically decreases the chance of critters spawning from destroyed tall grass and plants. Flower Boots can occasionally be found in Ivy Chests, Jungle Crates and Bramble Crates.

=== Rolling Cactus ===
Description: The Rolling Cactus is a placeable object that behaves similarly to the Boulder. It is stationary when placed, and begins to move when hit by projectiles, pickaxes, or drills, or when the blocks under it are mined or hammered. Its roll direction is determined by whether its horizontal position in the world is an odd or even number, regardless of the slope of the surface it is on (unless it is blocked on one side by blocks, in which case it rolls in the other direction). When both blocks under a Rolling Cactus are removed or hammered into a half-block, it will drop vertically until it hits a surface, then bounce and roll. A Rolling Cactus projectile pierces an unlimited number of entities. When a Rolling Cactus that has already started rolling falls onto a lower surface, it maintains its forward momentum while bouncing back up, releasing 2–4 Rolling Cactus Spikes that travel in random directions. Hitting a vertical obstacle also releases Spikes, but destroys the Rolling Cactus. A Rolling Cactus' movement is affected by liquids, and it can roll uphill. A stationary Rolling Cactus deals 21–29 damage when a player touches it.[1] A Rolling Cactus projectile deals 76–104 / 152–280 / 228–312 damage to players (38–52 damage to NPCs, enemies, and critters) and deals a knockback of 10 (Extremely strong) on contact.[2] Each Rolling Cactus Spike deals 51–69 / 102–138 / 153–207 damage to players (26–34 damage to NPCs, enemies, and critters), deals a knockback of 2 (Very weak), pierces entities, and breaks on contact with blocks.[3]

=== The Grand Design ===
Description: The Grand Design is a tool for working with wiring and mechanisms. It combines and extends the abilities of its components: It allows a controlled view of wiring (Mechanical Lens), and allows the player to place or remove any color of wire (Multicolor Wrench); unlike its components, it also shows and works with Actuators. It also provides the Ruler's ability to measure distances and relative positions. Creating the Grand Design costs 1410 in total. All of its components can be bought from the Mechanic. Given the requirements of crafting The Grand Design, it can only be created after Skeletron has been defeated. The Grand Design can be used at any part of the screen, regardless of block placement range. When pressing ⚷ Interact with the tool, a small menu will pop up at the cursor's position with six different buttons in a radial pattern. The outside buttons can be used to select which wire colors (including Actuators) can be interacted with, and the middle button will toggle between placing or harvesting the designated wires. In addition, as long as The Grand Design is anywhere in the inventory, seven buttons will appear on the left-hand side of the screen, controlling whether to display the ruler or not and whether to highlight actuators and/or the four different colors of wires. You can also toggle between Forced and Regular wire visibility (Forced always shows wires, Regular only shows wires when holding The Grand Design).

=== Mrs. Claus set ===
Description: The Mrs. Claus set is a vanity set. It is dropped from Presents obtained during the Christmas event, with a chance of 1.08% in pre-Hardmode and 1.001% in Hardmode.


=== War Table ===
Description: The War Table is an animated furniture item that is dropped by the Dark Mage during the Old One's Army event. During the last Tier 1 wave, it has a 50*1/2 (50%) / 100*1/1 (100%) chance to drop; during the fourth and sixth Tier 3 waves, it has a 12.5*1/8 (12.5%) / 25*1/4 (25%) chance to drop. Placing and pressing ⚷ Interact on the War Table grants the Strategist buff, which increases the player's sentry capacity by 1. This lasts until the player dies or leaves the world, but can be canceled at any time. This lasts for 0 seconds, but can be canceled at any time by right-clicking the icon ( ), by selecting the icon and canceling it in the equipment menu (), or by double-tapping the buff icon ().. Unlike equipment buff items, the War Table must be placed in order to activate the buff. It can be mined with a pickaxe or drill and picked up again, even while the buff is active, which will not cancel the buff. Placement is only dependent on an adequate space of 5×4 tiles being available.


=== Flying Knife ===
Description: The Flying Knife is a unique Hardmode melee weapon that has a 25*1/4 (25%) chance to be dropped by the Hallowed Mimic. It throws a reusable cursor-controllable projectile similar to the Magic Missile mechanic, though more erratic and with no mana cost. Like boomerangs, the projectile returns to the player. Holding the ⚒ Use / Attack button after use directs the projectile's general path, although it also continuously moves on its own and ricochets off blocks. As such, it may require a little practice to be used properly. It returns to the player when the ⚒ Use / Attack button is released, or after one minute of continuous use. Being a melee weapon, it costs no mana or ammunition. The Flying Knife also emits a good deal of light during use, but it may be difficult to use considering its erratic movement. Like most piercing weapons, it is very effective against enemies with multiple segments. Its best modifier is Godly or Demonic. Both modifiers increase the average damage output by the same amount. However, the bonus knockback granted by the Godly modifier is not always beneficial and makes it tricky to damage the same targets. For example, the knife will not necessarily be knocking enemies away from the player. Alternatively, modifiers that reduce knockback (the best being Ruthless) can be beneficial, reducing the distance enemies are knocked away from the cursor.


=== TNT Barrel ===
Description: The TNT Barrel is a Functional Furniture item that explodes when Enemies or Player weapons come in contact with it, inflicting 400 damage. The explosion covers ten tiles and will not destroy blocks in a radius.

Description: Meteorite Bars are a pre-Hardmode tier of bars. Crafting most items involving Meteorite requires the Meteorite to be crafted into bars first. Crafting all items on the PC, Console, Mobile, Old Chinese, tModLoader, and tModLoader Legacy versions, excluding Meteor Shot, requires 180 Meteorite Bars. This number increases to 270 / 255 if the player wishes to craft one of each color of phaseblade.

It emits a very small amount of light.


=== Night Vision Helmet ===

For the player wearing it, it increases the apparent light level provided by all light sources on the screen, similarly to the Night Owl buff.

Before reaching full firing speed, the Laser Machinegun will spin up for roughly two seconds. Each shot fires 2 inaccurate lasers. Like the Razorpine, the projectiles do not pierce through enemies. Its best modifier is Mythical.


=== Actuator ===
Description: The Actuator is a mechanism item purchased from the Mechanic for 10 each, or harvested from sand, lava, or Dead Man's Chest traps. It has to be connected with wiring to function.

=== Squirrel ===
Description: Squirrels are harmless critters that can be caught with a Bug Net and do not normally interact with the player in any other way, except in that they can be killed by both players and enemies. They have 5 health and usually serve as ambient entities in Terraria. Similar to Bunnies, they appear in the Forest biome. On PC, Console, Mobile, Old Chinese, tModLoader, and tModLoader Legacy, the Gold Squirrel has a 1 in 150 chance of spawning instead of a normal one. These gold critters sell for 10 each. Gold critters are rare creatures which are detected by the Lifeform Analyzer. Visual identification is helped by the sparkles they emit when alive in the world. Most naturally spawned Squirrels can be caught with a Bug Net, and carried in the player's inventory (or placed in storage). If a critter caught with any Bug Net is taken from inventory and "used" (placed), it is again released into the environment at the cursor and behaves as usual. On PC, Console, Mobile, Old Chinese, tModLoader, and tModLoader Legacy, Squirrels can be sold to any NPC vendor. All caught Squirrels can be crafted into Squirrel Cages to create animated display furniture. Once crafted, the critter cannot be released. The Squirrel Cage occupies a 6x3 space. The Squirrel inside may follow these patterns randomly: On PC, Console, Mobile, tModLoader, and tModLoader Legacy, Critters spawned from statues cannot be caught with the Bug Net; attempting to do so will cause the critter to disappear in a puff of smoke. If critter hunting on PC version, Console version, Mobile version, and tModLoader version, the best way to spawn any gem bunny or squirrel is to make a cavern town (not underground, it is one layer deeper) with three NPCs having moved in. The Bestiary entry for the Squirrel: "Fast moving and erratic woodland creatures with grayish-brown fur. Got nuts? "

=== Luminite Bar ===
Description: Luminite Bars are a type of bar used to craft all four sets of endgame armor and tools as well as other endgame items. The only way to obtain it is to craft it from Luminite, which is dropped from the Moon Lord, at an Ancient Manipulator. Each time the Moon Lord is killed, it drops enough Luminite for 17-25 bars (21-27 in Expert/Master mode). Crafting all items (excluding ammunition) requires a total of 317 Luminite Bars (1,268 Luminite; requires defeating the Moon Lord 15–19 / 12–15 times). Crafting all items pertaining to one type of Lunar Fragment (i.e., armor, wings, pickaxe, and hamaxe) requires 68 Luminite Bars (272 Luminite) in addition to 85 of the Lunar Fragment; this requires defeating the Moon Lord only 3 / 2-3 times.

=== Dirt Wall ===
Description: Dirt Wall is a background wall made from Dirt Blocks. A naturally occurring variety of Dirt Walls are generated with a new world, as the background in most caves and under most overhangs above 0 depth (above the Underground layer). They will not stop enemies from spawning and are not suitable for housing. In addition, they drop nothing when destroyed with a Hammer. Non-naturally occurring Dirt Walls can be recognized by their slightly different sprite (they have tiny grey stones, where natural ones are plain dirt but have occasional large rocks). Additionally, they function properly for housing, and drop items when broken. They blend with the generated walls.

=== Sniper Rifle ===
Description: The Sniper Rifle is a Hardmode, post-Plantera ranged weapon that fires a bullet with extremely high damage and velocity, though at a far slower rate of fire than most ranged weapons, and cannot auto-fire (except on the Mobile version). It also has a "zoom" ability. The Sniper Rifle has a 8.33*1/12 (8.33%) / 15.97*23/144 (15.97%) chance to be dropped by Skeleton Snipers, who most commonly spawn in Dungeon areas with Slab Walls during Hardmode after Plantera has been defeated. The Sniper Rifle's "zoom" ability is functionally identical to that of the Binoculars and the Rifle Scope and its upgrades. It allows the screen to scroll temporarily in the direction of the cursor, essentially extending the viewing range in one direction. Zoom is activated via one of the following methods: The Sniper Rifle has a base 29% / 19% critical strike chance, as opposed to the usual 4%. It is one of the few weapons lacking auto-fire on the Nintendo 3DS version. Its best modifier is Unreal.


=== Eventide ===
Description: The Eventide is a Hardmode, post-Plantera bow that auto-fires five rainbow-colored Twilight Lance projectiles if Wooden Arrows are used as ammunition. One of the lances will do double base damage. When using other ammunition, one of the five shots fired by the bow will be converted into a Twilight Lance and do double the base damage. All lances or arrows are aimed at the cursor. The lances can pierce up to four enemies. The Eventide has a 25*1/4 (25%) chance of being dropped by the Empress of Light. Its best modifier is Unreal.


=== Wooden Sword ===
Description: The Wooden Sword is an early-game melee weapon, and the weakest out of the seven wooden swords. It is considered a significant upgrade from the starting Copper Shortsword due to its higher damage and broadsword arc motion. This facilitates pushing enemies further away, and it is therefore recommended to craft this sword as soon as possible. All newly created characters begin with a Wooden Sword instead of a Copper Shortsword. It inflicts less damage than the Copper Shortsword, however it can strike flying enemies (unlike the Copper Shortsword). Its best modifier is Legendary.

They can be planted manually by the player year-round by purchasing Pumpkin Seeds from the Dryad NPC and placing them on grass on the surface. They also grow naturally randomly on grass during the Halloween and Oktoberfest seasonal events. Harvesting fully grown Pumpkins during the Halloween season will rarely yield a Magical Pumpkin Seed, which is used to summon the Squashling pet.

Its best modifier is Godly or Demonic. Both modifiers increase the average damage output by the same amount.

Description: The Eggnog is a type of healing potion dropped from Presents obtained during the Christmas event, with a chance of 8.101% in pre-Hardmode and 7.561% in Hardmode. It heals 80 health points. Because it can be potentially found so early on, Eggnog can be used as a viable alternative to Lesser Healing Potions.

=== Shroomite Digging Claw ===

It deals 15 pickaxe hits per second without any modifiers, and 20 with the Legendary modifier. It can mine almost every block in the game in 1 hit, with the exception of a few blocks. Mythril Ore, Orichalcum Ore, Adamantite Ore, Titanium Ore, and Wooden Spikes take 2 hits and Chlorophyte Ore takes 3. It chops any tree in 0.27 seconds without any modifiers, and 0.2 seconds with the Light modifier. See also Mining Speed for a comparison of all mining tools in the game.

Description: The Ebonwood Hammer is a low-tier hammer. Stat-wise, it is superior to the Copper and Tin Hammers, but not as potent as the Lead and Iron Hammers.

=== Terragrim ===
Description: The Terragrim is a rare pre-Hardmode melee weapon that appears to be a sword, but does not present an actual blade when used. Instead of an overhead broadsword swing or a shortsword stab, the Terragrim autoswings and appears as a series of blurred slashes aimed in the direction of the cursor. Anything within this area takes constant damage at a rate far exceeding the weapon's stated use time. This damaging area has a rather wide spread, even attacking behind the player for a very short distance. It is obtainable from the unique background object found in an Enchanted Sword Shrine or very rarely in the Caverns layer. When the object is destroyed, it has a 2*1/50 (2%) chance to drop a Terragrim rather than an Enchanted Sword. The Terragrim's unique means of attack is unaffected by any size and speed modifiers. Its best modifier is Godly or Demonic. Both modifiers increase the average damage output by the same amount.


=== High Test Fishing Line ===
Description: The High Test Fishing Line is an accessory with a 2.5*1/40 (2.5%)[1] chance of being awarded by the Angler for completing a quest. While equipped, it prevents fishing line from breaking while fishing. Without the High Test Fishing Line equipped, there is a 1 in 7 chance that the line will break on any reel-in that was supposed to yield a catch. On the PC version, Console version, Mobile version, and tModLoader version, the Angler will not give the player a High Test Fishing Line as a reward if they already have one in their inventory or in any of their Portable Storages. However, if the player has a High Test Fishing Line, Angler Earring, and Tackle Box (or they have the accessory crafted from them, the Angler Tackle Bag) in their inventories, he will be able to give the player duplicate High Test Fishing Lines.[1]

The dye gives a golden, metallic hue and a slight pulsating effect to anything used with it, similar to the Reflective Dyes obtainable from the Dye Trader's Strange Plants quest. Unlike the Metallic dyes, however, items dyed with Solar Dye do not appear to dynamically reflect light, and have the same appearance regardless of the player's proximity to light sources. Also unlike the metallic dyes, dyed items periodically glow (without casting light).

It is one of the possible rewards from the Angler upon completing one of his fishing quests, with a 1.43*1/70 (1.43%) chance per quest after the 10th quest. On PC, Console, Mobile, and tModLoader, it is available in pre-hardmode, as a guaranteed drop at 25 quests. On tModLoader Legacy, it is only available in hardmode.

The mount bobs to the surface when the ▼ Down key is released, and if deep enough, the player will launch out of the water into the air. This feature no longer functions while wearing Neptune's Shell or any effect that turns the player into a Merfolk. The flamingo will run unhindered underwater while the player has this buff.


=== Tally Counter ===
Description: The Tally Counter is a post-Skeletron informational accessory which displays how many enemies of a type have been killed. The Tally Counter will first display "Kill count unavailable" underneath the map/health area and after an enemy has been attacked, the text will display how many times that enemy has ever been killed by all players combined in that world. The kill count will only display the last enemy struck by the player or their minions. It will count deaths from world creation rather than from when it was equipped. It has a 1*1/100 (1%) chance of being dropped from Angry Bones, Cursed Skulls, and Dark Casters, all of which are found in the Dungeon. The Tally Counter is one of the three parts necessary to make the R.E.K. 3000, with the others being the Lifeform Analyzer and the Radar, and as such is a required ingredient in making the Cell Phone.

Each ricochet causes the bolt to pierce one less enemy and vice versa. Like other bows and repeaters, it can use any arrow type as ammunition.

Crafting all pieces of Turtle armor requires a total of 3 Turtle Shells, but, since Beetle Armor has two chest variants, you would need 4 Turtle Shells to craft the armor with both chest pieces. On average, you will need to kill 105 Giant Tortoises for a 95% chance to get 3 Turtle Shells (140 for 99%). If you want to get 4 Turtle Shells instead, this number is raised to 130 for 95% chance (and 168 for 99%).

The only lasting advantage a Mythical Sanguine Staff has over a Ruthless one is knockback.

Description: The Mirage Crate is a Hardmode crate that can only be fished in the Desert biome. Mirage Crates contain items found in standard crates, and always contain one item normally found in a Sandstone Chest in the Underground Desert. It has a texture resembling that of the Forbidden armor. Its pre-Hardmode counterpart is the Oasis Crate. Note: Only one type of ore and one type of bar can drop, not both a pre-Hardmode type of ore and a Hardmode type of ore, or both a pre-Hardmode type of bar and a Hardmode type of bar. The table above implies otherwise with the respective groups being in separate rows, but that is for readability purposes. The chance that a type of ore is dropped is 14.29*1/7 (14.29%), and the chance that a type of bar is dropped is 25*1/4 (25%).

=== Explosives ===
Description: Explosives are a placeable, consumable mechanism that can be triggered using wiring. Triggering them causes a large explosion that covers a radius of ten tiles (up to 314 blocks total), destroying most placed blocks and items (except for explosion-proof items), and inflicting around 500 damage to entities – meaning they can kill or severely damage even players with late-game gear. Natural Explosive traps wired to Pressure Plates or Detonators can be found rarely underground, usually next to a vein of ores. Explosives can also be crafted.

=== Butcher's Chainsaw ===
Description: The Butcher's Chainsaw is a Hardmode, post-Plantera chainsaw that has a 2.5% / 3.75% (1/40 / 3/80) chance to drop from Butchers during a Solar Eclipse. Upon striking an enemy or critter, it will emit sparks akin to the projectiles produced by the Wand of Sparking, dealing damage to nearby enemies/extra segments as well. These sparks deal melee damage / magic damage, meaning that any melee / magic buffs, accessories, or armor will boost them. They also have a chance to inflict the Hellfire debuff. Its best modifier is Godly or Demonic. Both modifiers increase the average damage output by the same amount. The Demonic modifier lacks the 15% knockback gain.


=== Anti-Portal Block ===
Description: The Anti-Portal Block is a Hardmode block that prevents portals made from the Portal Gun to form. This can be useful for map makers who want to make some places inaccessible by portals. They are purchased from the Traveling Merchant for 1 each.


=== Kaleidoscope ===
Description: The Kaleidoscope is a post-Plantera whip that has a 25*1/4 (25%) chance of being dropped by the Empress of Light boss. Like other whips, it causes minions to focus on the last-struck enemy and increases their damage against the target. Its best modifier is Legendary.


=== Cobalt Drill ===
Description: The Cobalt Drill is a Hardmode drill, and is the drill alternative to the Cobalt Pickaxe. Appearances and sounds aside, the two tools are nearly functionally identical. The drill, however is half a second faster. But, unlike pickaxes, most drills cannot be reforged with size, speed, or knockback modifiers. It can mine any block except Adamantite Ore, Titanium Ore, Chlorophyte Ore, and Lihzahrd Bricks. Its best modifier is Demonic, as it does not have any knockback and thus cannot get modifiers that affect it, and furthermore cannot get modifiers that affect its speed, either.

=== Eye of the Golem ===

Description: The Thorn Chakram is a Pre-Hardmode boomerang that returns to its user after reaching its maximum distance or hitting an enemy. It differs from most other boomerangs in that it does not necessarily return immediately when impacting an object, but instead can ricochet off solid surfaces before returning. The Thorn Chakram has a 50*1/2 (50%) chance to inflict the Poisoned debuff. It will not fly out through ceilings or floors; but when returning to you, it will fly back through them. Its best modifier is Godly or Demonic. Both modifiers increase the average damage output by the same amount.

=== Brand of the Inferno ===
Description: The Brand of the Inferno is a Hardmode sword dropped by the Ogre mini-boss during the Old One's Army event. It has a 25*1/4 (25%) chance of inflicting the On Fire! debuff for 5 seconds. With any equipped shield (including the Squire's Shield, but not Huntress's Buckler) and holding this sword, pressing the ⚷ Interact button will cause the character to brace for the next attack (like Sergeant United Shield). When timed correctly, just before taking a hit, the enemy's attack will be parried, dealing some damage to the attacker and granting the Striking Moment buff for the next 5 seconds. This allows the next melee attack to deal 5 times the damage. Alternatively, if the shield is held in place, 20 defense is temporarily gained; this lasts until the shield is once again lowered. Its best modifier is Legendary.


=== Mushroom Spear ===
Description: The Mushroom Spear is a Hardmode spear that can be purchased from the Truffle for 70 after at least one of the Mechanical bosses have been defeated. When used, it will extend the reach of the spear by summoning seven spinning mushrooms that hang in midair. It deals the third highest amount of damage out of all the spears, beaten only by the Obsidian Swordfish and the North Pole. Its best modifier is Godly or Demonic. Both modifiers increase the average damage output by the same amount.


=== Bunny ===
Description: Bunnies are harmless critters that can be caught with a Bug Net and do not normally interact with the player in any other way, except in that they can be killed by both players and enemies. They have 5 health and usually serve as ambient entities in Terraria. Bunnies usually spawn only in the middle-third of the above-ground world, and only on ordinary Grass, though they can also spawn near NPCs in other locations. Bunnies are less likely to spawn in Hardmode and can be spawned by using a Bunny Statue attached to a Lever, a Pressure Plate or a Switch. During a Blood Moon, or when hit with Vile Powder or Vicious Powder, Bunnies will turn into Corrupt Bunnies or Vicious Bunnies, which have much more health and are aggressive. During the Halloween seasonal event, Bunnies spawn wearing Green Slime costumes, during Christmas, Bunnies will spawn wearing Santa costumes, and during a Party, Bunnies can spawn with Party Hats. On PC, Console, Mobile, Old Chinese, tModLoader, and tModLoader Legacy, the Gold Bunny has a 1 in 150 chance of spawning instead of a normal one. These gold critters sell for 10 each. Gold critters are rare creatures which are detected by the Lifeform Analyzer. Visual identification is helped by the sparkles they emit when alive in the world. Most naturally spawned Bunnies can be caught with a Bug Net, and carried in the player's inventory (or placed in storage). If a critter caught with any Bug Net is taken from inventory and "used" (placed), it is again released into the environment at the cursor and behaves as usual. On PC, Console, Mobile, Old Chinese, tModLoader, and tModLoader Legacy, Bunnies can be sold to any NPC vendor. All caught Bunnies can be crafted into Bunny Cages to create animated display furniture. Once crafted, the critter cannot be released. A captured Bunny can also be used to craft an Explosive Bunny to be fired from the Bunny Cannon. On PC, Console, Mobile, tModLoader, and tModLoader Legacy, Critters spawned from statues cannot be caught with the Bug Net; attempting to do so will cause the critter to disappear in a puff of smoke. Gem Bunnies spawn near towns in the Cavern layer.

=== Houndius Shootius ===
Description: The Houndius Shootius is a pre-Hardmode sentry summon weapon. It can summon the Houndius Shootius sentry, which lasts for 10 minutes / 2 minutes , remains stationary, and does not count against the player's minion capacity. It has a 25*1/4 (25%) chance to be dropped by the Deerclops. When used, the sentry will attempt to summon at the cursor, however, if used while the cursor is midair, the sentry will spawn on the closest blocks directly downwards of the cursor. The Houndius Shootius shoots projectiles at enemies from a floating eyeball. The eyeball will point towards the player unless an enemy is close enough to attack, in which case it will point towards the enemy. Its best modifier is Ruthless. The Mythical modifier provides the widest array of stat bonuses, but these primarily affect the initial summon rather than the resulting minion. Additionally, minions cannot deal critical hits. The only lasting advantage a Mythical Houndius Shootius has over a Ruthless one is knockback.


=== Iridescent Brick Wall ===
Description: Iridescent Brick Wall is a background wall crafted from Iridescent Bricks. In some worlds it can also be harvested from Jungle Shrines. It reflects the color of the light that it is lit with.

=== Bunny Cannon ===
Description: The Bunny Cannon is a weapon purchased from the Pirate for 50, when the Party Girl is present, and one Hardmode boss has been defeated. It works like a Cannon, albeit firing explosive bunnies instead of cannonballs. Similar to the Cannon, the Bunny Cannon can also be triggered by wire. Depending on where the wire is connected, it will either shoot an explosive bunny or rotate toward the side the wire is on. Note that the explosive bunny fired in this manner is purely aesthetic and will do no damage to NPCs or players.


=== Ocram's Razor ===
Description: Ocram's Razor is a secret boss summon item that can only be obtained and used in the secret ''Everything'' seed. When used, it summons Mechdusa, an amalgamation of the 3 mechanical bosses who must be defeated to obtain the Waffle's Iron and progress the game. It cannot be crafted outside of the ''Everything'' seed and using it outside of the seed will do nothing. On any world that wasn't generated with the Everything seed, its description says "It has no effect in this world".

=== Pirate Staff ===
Description: The Pirate Staff is a Hardmode, pre-mechanical boss summon weapon. It spawns a pirate minion that attacks enemies by slashing them with a sword. Like other minions, the summoned Pirate is invincible and follows the player for an unlimited amount of time, unless the player dies, summons a replacement minion, cancels the buff, or leaves the world. The Pirate Staff is dropped with a 0.05*1/2000 (0.05%) chance by pirates, with a 1*1/100 (1%) chance by the Flying Dutchman or in a loot_box (every type of it) Its best modifier is Ruthless. The Mythical modifier provides the widest array of stat bonuses, but these primarily affect the initial summon rather than the resulting minion. Additionally, minions cannot deal critical hits. The only lasting advantage a Mythical Pirate Staff has over a Ruthless one is knockback.


=== Shark Fin ===
Description: The Shark Fin is a crafting material that has a 95% / 98% chance of being dropped by Sharks found in the Ocean biome, and a 12.5*1/8 (12.5%) chance of being dropped by Sand Sharks during a Sandstorm.

=== Red's Throw ===
Description: Red's Throw is a Expert Mode-exclusive yoyo. It is obtainable from any Hardmode boss's Treasure Bag (except for Queen Slime) as part of Red's set. Like certain other yoyos, Red's Throw can be held in the air indefinitely. Its best modifier is Godly or Demonic. Both modifiers increase the average damage output by the same amount.


=== Geyser ===
Description: Geysers are traps that spew a vertical stream of fire when triggered via wire or when stepped on by a player. They are found naturally-placed in random areas that are deep enough to generate lava, including the Underworld and deeper Cavern areas. On the PC version, Console version, Mobile version, and tModLoader version, they will activate when a player touches them, and will generate without Pressure Plates or wires. However, they can still be triggered by wires. On the tModLoader 1.3-Legacy version, they can only be triggered by wires, and will generate with Pressure Plates wired to them. They consume no ammunition, and their output is limited only by a cooldown period of 3.33 (3 1/3) seconds. Geyser streams extend approximately 20 tiles up or down, depending on placement. Geysers can be placed on the top or bottom of blocks, facing upward or downward respectively, but not sideways.


=== Golem Fist ===
Description: The Golem Fist is a Hardmode, post-Golem flail-type weapon that has a 14.29*1/7 (14.29%) / 12.5*1/8 (12.5%) chance of being dropped by the Golem. It fires a large fist attached to a chain that retracts on impact, similar to the one Golem uses. It fires forward at a rapid rate, similar to the KO Cannon and Harpoon. Firing at closer targets causes its fire rate to increase. The Golem Fist is one of the few flail-type weapons which contributes a gun-firing mechanism. It has the second highest knockback of all weapons, beaten only by the Slap Hand. The Golem Fist has a very short cool down period; therefore its auto-fire rate is dependent only on the distance to its impact, meaning that an enemy or object in close range will cause a faster autofire rate. Its best modifier is Godly or Demonic. Both modifiers increase the average damage output by the same amount.


=== Titanium Trident ===
Description: The Titanium Trident is a Hardmode spear crafted solely using Titanium Bars. It has the highest damage of the "standard" Hardmode Ore spears, but it's still beaten by the Chlorophyte Partisan, which has the highest damage of all Hardmode Ore spears. Unlike the pre-Hardmode Trident, the Titanium Trident does not improve the player's underwater mobility. Its best modifier is Godly or Demonic. Both modifiers increase the average damage output by the same amount.

When used, it creates glowing pink circles at the cursor's location, which expand and then collapse into sparkles over the course of about 1 second. Rapid damage is dealt to any enemies within the circles throughout the animation, and they are knocked back away from the caster. It is not possible to summon the circles through blocks. The scepter in the player's hand also sparkles while it is used, emitting pink light. Its best modifier is Mythical.

Its best modifier is Legendary. While Light may seem to provide a better speed boost by percentages, rounding reveals that Legendary and Light mine at equal speeds for this tool.


=== Silly Balloon Machine ===
Description: The Silly Balloon Machine is a novelty furniture mechanism that produces red, blue, and green balloons continuously once placed. It can be activated and deactivated via wire, but is always on by default when first placed. Once placed, balloons are produced at short random intervals, and rise in the air until they encounter an obstacle like a block or platform. Balloons do not burst or disappear upon colliding with objects, but those do hinder their movement. All balloons fade away after approximately 10 seconds. The balloons are purely visual, with no functional effect, and can be produced infinitely at no cost. The Silly Balloon Machine is purchased from the Party Girl for 5.


=== Tin Hammer ===
Description: The Tin Hammer is the Copper Hammer's counterpart, and is slightly stronger. Like all hammers, it is used to remove background walls and create sloped tiles and half tiles.

=== Medusa Head ===
Description: The Medusa Head is a Hardmode magic weapon that has a 2*1/50 (2%) chance of being dropped by Medusas, which are encountered in Marble Caves. On the PC version, Console version, Mobile version, and tModLoader version, the Medusa Head continuously attacks up to four times per second, striking up to three enemies per attack within a short range of the player. 15 mana is consumed per each attack, regardless of the number of enemies struck. No mana is consumed if the weapon is used while there are no enemies within range. On the Old Chinese version and tModLoader 1.3-Legacy version, this weapon can be charged for up to 3 seconds to deal additional damage, consuming 15 mana per second to a maximum cost of 45. A 1-second charge doubles the damage, while the full charge of 3 seconds triples the damage.

Its best modifier is Mythical.


=== Hellstone Crate ===
Description: The Hellstone Crate is a Hardmode crate that can only be fished in lava. Opening Hellstone and Obsidian Crates is the only way to obtain the Obsidian Lock Box, and therefore any Underworld-exclusive items normally found in locked Shadow Chests, once the Underworld has been fully looted. Its pre-Hardmode counterpart is the Obsidian Crate. Note: Only one type of ore and one type of bar can drop, not both a pre-Hardmode type of ore and a Hardmode type of ore, or both a pre-Hardmode type of bar and a Hardmode type of bar. The table above implies otherwise with the respective groups being in separate rows, but that is for readability purposes. The chance that a type of ore is dropped is 14.29*1/7 (14.29%), and the chance that a type of bar is dropped is 25*1/4 (25%).

Description: The Chromatic Cloak is a Hardmode accessory which allows a more controlled Shimmering. When equipped, touching Shimmer does not inflict the Shimmering debuff, and the player can instead start Shimmering at any time while under Shimmer by holding the ▼ Down key. However, after Shimmering starts, it cannot be interrupted, not even by re-equipping the Chromatic Cloak. The Chromatic Cloak can be replaced with the Water Walking Boots, Obsidian Water Walking Boots, Lava Waders, or Terraspark Boots, as they have the same effect as the Chromatic Cloak, allowing the player to walk on shimmer, as well as other benefits that the Chromatic Cloak does not have.

=== Guide Voodoo Doll ===
Description: The Guide Voodoo Doll is a summoning item for the Wall of Flesh. It is a guaranteed drop from Voodoo Demons, a fairly rare enemy in The Underworld. When the doll is equipped as an accessory, it becomes possible for the player and other NPCs to kill the Guide with direct attacks from weapons (which normally would not damage him). If the item is dropped and destroyed by lava, then the Guide will instantly die, if he exists in the world. If the doll is destroyed in The Underworld (and the Guide exists), it will summon the Wall of Flesh. As of 1.4.4 Guide Voodoo Dolls can be stacked up to 9,999. Throwing a stack of more than one into the lava will summon the Wall of Flesh, and kill the Guide, as well as killing a number of other randomly chosen NPCs in the world (including town pets and town slimes), equal to the number of dolls that were thrown. There are no other effects to doing this, however. The Guide Voodoo Doll cannot be reforged, and therefore cannot have modifiers.

Conveniently, Rich Mahogany trees regrow on their own in the Jungle biomes and do not require the player to plant Acorns. In fact, Jungle trees do normally not drop any sort of Acorns, however if branches of a Jungle tree are over a Grass tile they can sometimes drop Acorns when chopped down. Do note that Rich Mahogany tools are more powerful than their classic Wood counterparts. This is also true of Shadewood, Ebonwood and Pearlwood tools.

Similar to Locked Golden Chests, the first chest to be generated in the world will always have the first primary item, the second will always have the second item, and the third will always have the third item. All Floating Island houses past the first three will then have a random primary item. Therefore, the vast majority of worlds will generate at least one copy of all 3 items. All Skyware Chests have an equal chance of containing the Sky Mill. As of 1.4.4, Skyware chests have a chance of containing the Celestial Magnet. Aside from these exclusive items, Skyware Chests have the same common drops as Surface Chests.

It can also be used as bait, and along with the other golden bait critters, it has a bait power of 50%, the highest usable value among bait. When thrown in shimmer, it will transform into a Gummy Worm, a consumable item that grants a permanent fishing buff. Unlike its original counterpart, the Worm, the Gold Worm cannot be crafted into an Enchanted Nightcrawler. It is one of the few entities that can be detected by the Lifeform Analyzer or its upgrades. As of 1.4.4 Gold Worms have an additional hidden reduced chance to be consumed, 1/20 (5%), this does not change the bait power so it does not give higher quality fishing catches compared to other gold baits.

Description: The Staff of the Frost Hydra is a Hardmode post-Plantera sentry summon weapon. It can summon the Frost Hydra sentry, which lasts for 10 minutes / 2 minutes , remains stationary, and does not count against the player's minion capacity. The Staff of the Frost Hydra is always found in the Ice Chest within the Dungeon, which must be unlocked with its corresponding Frozen Key. The Frost Hydra will automatically angle its head up and down, and turn left and right, to target enemies in any direction. It will fire ice pellets at enemies within 60 tiles, inflicting the Frostbite debuff. The Frost Hydra can be summoned anywhere on the visible screen, even if blocks completely separate the player from the point clicked. It cannot, however, be summoned in the air, and will instead appear on the closest block or platform below the summoning point. Its best modifier is Ruthless. The Mythical modifier provides the widest array of stat bonuses, but these primarily affect the initial summon rather than the resulting minion. Additionally, minions cannot deal critical hits. The only lasting advantage a Mythical Staff of the Frost Hydra has over a Ruthless one is knockback.

The item is not consumed and can be used limitlessly. The Void Bag has an "open" and "closed" state, which can be toggled with right click. A closed Void Bag will no longer pick up overflow items, and functions more like a Money Trough. An open Void Bag still picks up overflow items, and has the ability for the player to use Quick Buff, Food, and Potions from its Storage. The player can also craft with the bag's contents, and will collect overflow from looting chests.

Deathweed can also be planted in Clay Pots and Planter Boxes using Deathweed Seeds. Deathweed blooms during a Blood Moon or a Full Moon at night (7:30 PM to 4:29 AM). The time when it is blooming is the only time that it will drop 1-3 Deathweed Seeds when cut. Deathweed will have a pulsating glow during this time, making it easy to spot. Harvesting it with the Staff of Regrowth will increase the number of seeds dropped while in bloom. The Staff of Regrowth can't be used to harvest the herb or seeds while not in bloom.

The Cell Phone has one of the most complex crafting trees in Terraria, using 13 base items (and 6 crafting operations), beaten by the Zenith, which uses 15, and the Shellphone which uses 14, followed by the Ankh Shield, which uses 12. Note this does not include ore smelting or the crafting of the chains. Unlike most other informational items (e.g. its constituent parts), the Cell Phone does not double as an accessory, and cannot be equipped in accessory slots. It instead functions solely from the player's ordinary inventory slots, which puts it into the tool category. While the inventory screen is open, Cell Phone information is hidden. Instead, an icon is displayed for each information type, each of which can be clicked to toggle their display on or off. In multiplayer, information from the Cell Phone will be shared with other nearby players on the same team.

Description: The Christmas Tree Sword is a Hardmode sword that fires ornament projectiles when swung. It has a chance to drop from Everscreams during the Frost Moon event. On the PC version, Console version, Mobile version, and tModLoader version, swinging the Christmas Tree Sword hurls a star ornament projectile in a straight line in the direction of the cursor which releases four randomly colored ornaments on its way. These ornaments move a few tiles, linger in the air for 50 ticks[1] (0.83 seconds), and then become affected by gravity and drop to the ground. They break upon contact with enemies or blocks. All projectiles deal 100% of the sword's damage (86 base damage), and the colored ornaments only inflict a quarter of the sword's knockback (1.75 (Very weak)).[2] On the Old-gen console version, Windows Phone version, Old Chinese version, and tModLoader 1.3-Legacy version, swinging the Christmas Tree Sword launches a single ornament in the direction of the cursor which is affected by gravity. It deals 50% of the sword's damage ( 43 / 36 base damage) and breaks upon contact with enemies or blocks. Unlike most other late-game swords, the Christmas Tree Sword is not capable of autoswing in these versions. Its best modifier is Legendary.

=== Peace Candle ===
Description: The Peace Candle is a furniture item that can be placed or held to decrease enemy and critter spawn rates in the area, and emits a low amount of light. When placed, it gives nearby players the Peace Candle buff. Holding a Peace Candle does not cause the buff icon to display, but still causes an identical effect. The Peace Candle can be made from a Pink Torch and either Gold Bars or Platinum Bars, meaning that the player needs to have defeated Pinky at least once to craft this item. The Peace Candle buff decreases spawn rates by 23% in the area, and decreases the maximum number of simultaneous on-screen enemies by 30%. The buff is applied to any players holding a Peace Candle or standing within a rectangular area of 169×125[1] () / 100×84 () tiles centered on a Peace Candle. In order to be considered "holding" the candle, it must be in the player's hotbar and currently selected; merely being in a player's inventory will not suffice. Multiple Candles will not stack with each other, even if one is placed and the other held. Peace Candles can only be placed on platforms and flat furniture items like Work Benches and Tables. Pressing the ⚷ Interact button on Peace Candles shuts them off, and they will toggle when activated via wiring. Peace Candles that are turned off will not activate the Peace Candle buff. Peace Candles cannot be turned off, and do not act as mechanisms. The opposite of the Peace Candle is the Water Candle, which increases enemy spawn rate instead. If a Peace Candle and a Water Candle are active at the same time, they will cancel each other's effects out, resulting in no difference in spawn rate.

=== Sergeant United Shield ===
Description: The Sergeant United Shield is a Hardmode boomerang. Only one can be thrown at a time. It automatically homes in on nearby enemies and will chain its attack to 4 additional enemies, however it will not hit an enemy more than once per throw. It is rarely sold by the Traveling Merchant for 35. Like the Brand of the Inferno, with any equipped shield (including the Sergeant United Shield when not thrown) and holding this boomerang, pressing the ⚷ Interact button will cause the character to brace for the next attack. When timed correctly, just before taking a hit, the enemy's attack will be parried, dealing some damage to the attacker and granting the Striking Moment buff for the next five seconds. This allows the next melee attack to deal 5× damage. Alternatively, if the shield is held in place, 20 defense is temporarily gained; this lasts until the shield is once again lowered. Its best modifier is Godly or Demonic. Both modifiers increase the average damage output by the same amount.


=== Silver Shortsword ===
Description: The Silver Shortsword is an early game metal shortsword. It is slightly weaker than its Tungsten version. Like all shortswords, the Silver Shortsword has a very limited range and attacks with a stabbing motion at any direction on PC, Console, Mobile, and tModLoader, and horizontally in front of the player on Old-gen console, Windows Phone, Old Chinese, 3DS, and tModLoader Legacy, instead of an arc. This makes it almost useless against flying or jumping enemies, although its high attack rate makes it somewhat effective against weaker fighter type enemies. Unless the player has a good reason to make the Shortsword (like not having very much Silver, or for completionist purposes) they are advised to make the Silver Broadsword as it does more damage and can swing in an arc. Its best modifier is Legendary.

In addition, it has a -1 range attribute which means it can only mine 4 blocks to the sides, and 2 blocks above and below the player. Like other low-tier pickaxes, it can only mine blocks and ores weaker than Meteorite (which requires a pickaxe with at least 50% pickaxe power, e.g. a Tungsten Pickaxe). The Copper Pickaxe is usually the first pickaxe that the player will obtain, as newly created characters spawn with this item in their second inventory slot, unless in Journey Mode.

Lava Waders also allow the player to submerge in lava safely for 7 seconds (press the ▼ Down key to submerge), without incurring lava damage or triggering the On Fire! debuff. The 7-second countdown is signified by a lava meter that displays over the player's head, similar to the Breath meter, but displaying flame icons instead of bubbles. Lava immunity time is recharged gradually by exiting lava, the same way breathing time is recharged by exiting water (albeit much more slowly). All liquids, including lava, can be walked on indefinitely while the Lava Waders are equipped. The countdown only applies when submerged in lava, whereas the player can stand on its surface indefinitely. Lava Waders additionally provide immunity to the Burning debuff incurred from contact with Meteorite, Hellstone or Hellstone Brick. It also reduces lava's base damage from 70 to 35. If you want the Lava Waders on PC, it is the same as on Console and Mobile. Note: Molten Skull rose doesn't require obsidian water walking boots, it requires normal water walking boots for the lava waders since you already have obtained the obsidian skull for the molten skull rose.

=== Chum Bucket ===
Description: The Chum Bucket is a consumable which increases fishing power when thrown into a liquid. It is dropped with a 50*1/2 (50%) chance from Blood Moon fishing enemies: the Wandering Eye Fish and Zombie Merman drop it in stacks of 4–6, and the Hemogoblin Shark, Blood Eel, and Dreadnautilus in stacks of 7–10. These enemies spawn when fishing during a Blood Moon. The fishing power bonus depends on how many Chum Buckets are present on the water's surface. A single bucket used will increase fishing power by 11, two for a total of 17 and finally three for a total max bonus of 20. This bonus is added after all other fishing factors and so isn't influenced by time factors like other fishing gear are; see the relevant section on Fishing for details. Each bucket lasts up to 10 times reeling in the line, even if nothing is on the line or if the line breaks. Using Chum Buckets does not change the chance of hooking enemies during a Blood Moon, but fishing using the Chum Caster doubles the chance.

Notes produce a reasonable amount of light and are not affected by gravity. The speed of each note can be controlled by clicking closer or further from the character: Closer clicks fire slower-moving notes, and further clicks fire faster notes. The speed at which each note travels does not affect their lifespan; all last about four seconds. The sound played upon firing resembles a plucked string, with its pitch correlating to the firing speed: Slower firings playing lower-pitched sounds, and faster firings playing higher-pitched sounds. Its best modifier is Mythical. Its best modifier is Demonic or Deadly for damage output, or Mystic for mana conservation because it cannot get modifiers that affect knockback.

=== Jungle Grass Seeds ===
Description: Jungle Grass Seeds are a type of Seeds that can be planted in Mud Blocks to grow Jungle Grass, potentially creating an artificial Jungle or Underground Jungle (depending on depth) if enough Jungle grass and plants are created. Jungle Grass Seeds can be found by cutting down plants growing on Jungle grass in Jungles using any tool or weapon. They can be used to craft Green Thread. They also can be used to craft Leafy Jungle Wall and Jungle Vine Wall. Jungle Grass Seeds have a 1*1/100 (1%) chance to drop from destroying any plant growing on Jungle grass. Charging through the entire surface jungle cutting down every single plant may only yield a few seeds. It is worth remembering though that Jungle Grass will spread to adjacent open Mud Blocks just as with any other Grass, if slowly. A single planted Jungle Grass Seed can eventually spread through an area of Mud of any size. It is possible to find the rare items such as Nature's Gifts in a player-made Underground Jungle. The most efficient setup for creating an Underground Jungle "farm" for harvesting Jungle Spores, Jungle Seeds, and Nature's Gifts, is to place a floor of jungle grass, and a ceiling 3 blocks in height. On the next layer up, do the same, but this time also add a middle layer so you have 3 lines with 1 space between each, and repeat. You can then harvest it easily by using a Muramasa, Blade of Grass, hammer or similar long reaching weapon or tool to harvest all 3 layers (the one you stand on and the two above it). Note that some items will get stuck above, but will be collected as you rise up the farm layers. This method is sometimes questioned due to the vines that can hang down and prevent some items spawning. However, in Underground Jungle biomes, grass and roses seem to grow faster than vines, so this should result in better yields in a smaller space than a simple 3 block high tunnel farm. An additional row of Wood Platforms right under the ceiling will prevent vines from growing altogether, while also letting the players enter without increasing the height of the farm.

This is the fastest pull-in speed of any hook in the game. On the PC version, Console version, Mobile version, and tModLoader version, the Bat Hook has a pull-in speed of 13 and a hook velocity of 13.5, which still makes it a very fast hook that can be acquired in the early game. It has the longest reach of all pre-Hardmode hooks, as well; still, some players may find a multi-hook (such as the Ivy Whip) preferable.


=== Sonar Potion ===
Description: The Sonar Potion is a buff potion which grants the Sonar buff when consumed. When fishing while under the effects of the potion, the name of what will be caught will appear above the lure when it is bitten. This lasts for 8 minutes, but can be canceled at any time by right-clicking the icon ( ), by selecting the icon and canceling it in the equipment menu ( ), by double-tapping the buff icon ( ), or by canceling the buff from the buffs screen (). This potion is especially useful, allowing the player to not waste bait on unnecessary fish as the cast can be left in the water until another fish bites at the line. This can be useful for angler quests as well as crate fishing. It also makes it so the player cannot get trash items even if they reel them in.

From some perspectives, the player may look 3D when this dye is equipped all over. As with other reflective dyes, this dye is not animated when standing still, but the shading on a dyed piece of equipment will change according to the surrounding light, giving it the appearance of light reflecting off of a shining metallic object. The following pictures show a player wearing Tungsten armor with the dye applied:

=== Harp ===
Description: The Harp is a Hardmode crafting material, used only to craft the Magical Harp. While the Harp can be used itself, it has no functional use, and only makes sounds. It is sold by the Wizard for 1 each. When used, the Harp generates harp sounds. The sound's pitch is determined by the distance between the center of the character and the point clicked. Clicking the center of the character plays middle C, while clicking at a distance of at least that of the top or bottom of the screen plays C6 (two octaves above middle C). The smallest interval between notes the harp can play is a whole tone, or two semitones. A difference of 1/24 of the screen height equals an interval of a whole tone. Since the whole-tone scale is not commonly used, most well known tunes cannot be played. Only the first four notes (C, D, E, F#) are in the same key (G major / E minor) as the guitars. The Harp and the Whoopie Cushion have similar effects, although the Whoopie Cushion cannot change pitch.

=== Ice Boomerang ===
Description: The Ice Boomerang is a melee weapon found in Frozen Chests in the Ice biome, as well as from Frozen and Boreal Crates. It behaves like a regular boomerang, but it is faster and emits light which can be used in dark areas. It is similar to the Enchanted Boomerang, dealing slightly more damage, but lacking the Flamarang upgrade. Its best modifier is Godly or Demonic. Both modifiers increase the average damage output by the same amount.

Both modifiers increase the average damage output by the same amount.


=== Umbrella Hat ===

Equipping it allows the player to perform a dash attack by double-tapping either the ◀ Left or ▶ Right key. Dashing into an enemy deals 30 damage, and grants momentary invincibility.


=== Red Brick Wall ===

=== Mechanical Eye ===
Description: The Mechanical Eye is a Hardmode item used to summon The Twins, the advanced and Hardmode version of the Eye of Cthulhu. It can only be used at night; using this item during the day will not spawn The Twins nor consume it. Using another Mechanical Eye while The Twins are active will not cause any additional effects, and will not be consumed. If The Twins have not been defeated yet in a Hardmode world, all enemies have a 0.04*1/2500 (0.04%) chance of dropping this item, with the exception of statue-spawned enemies, Meteor Heads, and Old One's Army enemies.

=== Lihzahrd Brick ===
Description: Lihzahrd Bricks make up the structure of the Jungle Temple. They are the toughest block in the game, being impervious to explosives and only breakable using the Picksaw or a better pickaxe or drill. They also cannot be made inactive using actuators until Plantera has been defeated, unless they are above the world's surface. Like jungle grass, placing 80 / 140 Lihzahrd Bricks in one area creates an artificial Jungle biome. This is not useful for growing jungle plants or spawning jungle monsters, as both require the grass, but makes setting up enemy drop farms easier once the Picksaw has been secured, as one does not need to wait for grass to spread and the introduction of the Jungle biome will generally increase spawn rates.

=== Dual Hook ===
Description: The Dual Hook is a Hardmode grappling hook which has a 16.67*1/6 (16.67%) / 14.29*1/7 (14.29%) chance to be dropped by Mimics. It reaches 27.5 tiles, and has 2 hooks which can be launched simultaneously; however, only one hook can be attached to a block at any time. Launching a second hook will not release the player from the first hook unless the new hook successfully attaches to a block.

=== Moon Lord Legs ===
Description: The Moon Lord Legs are an armor item for the pants slot. They have a 6.67*1/15 (6.67%) chance to be found in Chests in drunk worlds. The Moon Lord Legs replace the player's legs with Moon Lord-themed tentacles which produce a unique walking animation, a purely visual effect. In addition to providing 3 defense, the item has the following effects:


=== Phantasm ===
Description: The Phantasm is a Hardmode, post-Lunatic Cultist craftable bow that auto-fires four arrows at once, while only consuming a single arrow from the player's inventory. Arrows are loosely grouped and can fire with varied velocities and ranges (similar to the Chlorophyte Shotbow). The bow has a 66% chance of not consuming ammunition. Constantly shooting with the Phantasm will gradually increase its fire rate from once per 24 frames, up to once per 18 frames, regardless of use time, meaning that the Phantasm does not benefit from speed modifiers. Stopping the attack or switching to another item will reset this effect immediately, making switching weapons inefficient. In addition, each successful hit on an enemy causes 3 magical arrow projectiles to fire and home in on the target that was hit initially, each one dealing 30% of the original projectile's damage[1], without any additional ammo or mana cost. The rate of fire of these projectiles depends on the current rate of fire of the Phantasm. Its best modifier is Unreal. Since it does not benefit from speed modifiers, Godly and Demonic provide the same DPS bonus as Unreal.

=== Owl ===
Description: The Owl is a critter that spawns on the surface Forest during the night. Since it has only 5 HP and no defense, like all critters, it is often killed instantly by enemies or the player. It can be caught with any Bug Net to be carried around in the inventory and released later, or crafted into a Owl Cage to be used as decorative furniture. Once crafted, the caged Owl cannot be released again, and when placed down it moves around inside the cage as it would do outside.

=== Magic Cuffs ===
Description: The Magic Cuffs are a pre-Hardmode accessory which increases maximum mana by 20 and restores mana when the wearer is damaged. Mana restored is equal to the damage of the attack before factoring defense, but will never be lower than 10. Damage from drowning and debuffs does not trigger this effect, while damage from falling will. This effect does not stack with the mana restoration effect of the Celestial Cuffs.

=== Flame Trap ===
Description: The Flame Trap is a mechanism found naturally in the Jungle Temple. When activated, it fires a jet of fire, which has a range of 20 ( 47) blocks (slightly less than the Flamethrower), and can pierce an infinite number of enemies. It has a cooldown of 3.33 seconds / 3 seconds between firings and deals about 80 damage to players and 40 to enemies. Although naturally-generated Flame Traps are always found in the horizontal orientation, players can rotate them 90° using a hammer.


=== Desert Spirit Lamp ===
Description: The Desert Spirit Lamp is a placeable furniture item and crafting material. It must be placed on a platform or other flat-surface item. It has a 2.5*1/40 (2.5%) chance of being dropped from Desert Spirits, which can be encountered in the Corrupted or Crimson Underground Desert. However, the Desert Spirit will only drop one of its special drops at a time (i.e. it may drop either the Desert Spirit Lamp or the Djinn's Curse, but never both). It will first attempt to drop the Desert Spirit Lamp, and if it fails to do so, it will attempt to drop the Djinn's Curse.[1]

=== Fart in a Jar ===
Description: The Fart in a Jar is an accessory that allows the player to perform a double jump, accompanied by a farting sound effect. The fart jump will continue to propel you upwards if the ↷ Jump button is held, reaching up to 10.5 blocks on its own, or 16.5 blocks when put together with the first jump. Due to this behavior, the jump behaves more similarly to the Rocket Boots than the Cloud in a Bottle. Unlike the Rocket Boots, however, the jump cannot be used in multiple bursts, and cancelling the jump will forfeit the rest of the height.

Description: The Clockwork Assault Rifle is a Hardmode gun that fires in three-round bursts. It has a 12.5*1/8 (12.5%) / 25*1/4 (25%) chance to be dropped by the Wall of Flesh. Only the first shot out of the three will consume ammunition. The ⚒ Use / Attack button can be held for repeated fire. Its best modifier is Demonic, as it does not have any knockback and thus cannot get modifiers that affect it. It can also get the Deadly modifier, which, while the Demonic modifier may provide the greatest damage per hit, grants a higher increase to the overall DPS.


=== Vicious Mushroom ===
Description: A Vicious Mushroom is a species of mushroom found on tainted grass in The Crimson, where they can be cut and collected with a single swing of any Weapon or Tool. They cannot be eaten or brewed into any potions, and are used solely to craft Vicious Powder. Like other mushrooms, they can not be grown in a Clay Pot even with Crimson Grasses. Growing Vile Mushrooms will be converted into ordinary Mushrooms if they are purified using Purification Powder or the Clentaminator. Vicious Mushrooms can also be obtained by using Vicious Powder on Vile Mushrooms, and vice-versa. This is the only type of mushroom with a different inventory sprite. With its curvy stem instead of a profile straight stem.

Description: Cogs are a Hardmode crafting material and placeable block that is purchased from the Steampunker for 7 each. They are used to make High Velocity Bullets, Liquid Sensors and the Steampunk furniture set. When Cogs are placed together they will display animated machinery. Corners, lines, and junctions will never be animated, though blocks inside the group of cogs and the left border will always be animated and other borders are sometimes animated (2/3 chance).

=== Dirt Block ===
Description: Dirt Blocks are one of the most common block types in Terraria, covering the majority of the world's surface. Dirt Blocks may be covered by regular grass, Corrupt grass, Crimson grass, or Hallowed grass, which spreads from nearby grass-covered Dirt Blocks. It can also be turned into regular grass by using the Staff of Regrowth. Dirt occurs naturally almost everywhere throughout the world. All caves above the elevation of 0 ft are made of dirt. Below 0 ft, in the underground layer, the caves are made of roughly 50% dirt. Small patches of dirt can be found in the cavern layer, though it is mostly made of stone.

=== Abigail's Flower ===
Description: Abigail's Flower is a pre-Hardmode summon weapon that summons the Abigail minion. Abigail attacks by floating to enemies and flashing a light on them, similar to the Medusa Head. Like other minions, the summoned Abigail is invincible and follows the player for an unlimited amount of time, unless the player dies, summons a replacement minion, cancels the buff, or leaves the world. When idle, the summon will still do damage towards entities. Like the Stardust Dragon and the Desert Tiger, Abigail can only be summoned once but will gain damage and movement speed the more times she is summoned. Each time you re-summon her, an additional empty minion slot will be occupied. Abigail's Flower can be uncommonly found as a plant growing on grass near a placed Tombstone, regardless of world progression. Its spawn chance is increased in a Constant world. Its best modifiers are either Mythical, Furious, or Godly in Pre-Hardmode. Due to its low base damage, all damage-improving modifiers of +10% or greater improve its damage by the same amount. The Ruthless modifier has no lasting advantage over the others mentioned, as it deals less knockback.


=== Silver Bullet ===
Description: The Silver Bullet is a type of bullet used by guns. It deals 2 more damage and is slightly faster than Musket Balls. Silver Bullets can be bought from the Arms Dealer for 15 each, or 150 for 1000 rounds. During pre-Hardmode, they are only sold during a Blood Moon in worlds with Silver ( any world). Once Hardmode begins, they are always available. They can also be found replacing Wooden Arrows in Pots during Hardmode, in Shadow Chests, or crafted using Silver Bars. It is the counterpart to the Tungsten Bullet.

Description: The Vortex Fragment is a Hardmode, post-Lunatic Cultist crafting material. It is one of the four Lunar Fragments, dropped from the Vortex Pillar during the Lunar Events in stacks of 12–60 / 24–100. Vortex Fragments can be used to craft Vortex armor, an end-game armor set that benefits all types of ranged weapons, as well as Vortex-themed tools, weapons, wings, etc. Crafting all items requires 121 Vortex Fragments and 68 Luminite Bars (272 Luminite), which necessitates defeating the Vortex Pillar at least 3–11 / 2–8 times (note that the Vortex Fragment can also be crafted from the other fragments) and fighting the Moon Lord at least 4 / 3–4 times.

=== Crimson Heart (item) ===
Description: The Crimson Heart is a light pet item that summons a fast moving bleeding heart that emits dim, red light. It follows the player around, either by rolling or flying after the player. If it falls far behind the player, it will fly through blocks to catch up. It has a 20% chance of dropping from destroyed Crimson Hearts, but it can also be obtained by opening Crimson Crates, which are obtained by fishing in the Crimson. The Corruption counterpart to the Crimson Heart is the Shadow Orb.


=== Iron Shortsword ===
Description: The Iron Shortsword is an early game metal shortsword. It's stronger than the Copper and Tin Shortsword and has a slightly stronger alternate version known as the Lead Shortsword. Like all shortswords, the Iron Shortsword has a very limited range and attacks with a stabbing motion at any direction on PC, Console, Mobile, and tModLoader, and horizontally in front of the player on Old-gen console, Windows Phone, Old Chinese, 3DS, and tModLoader Legacy, instead of an arc. This makes it almost useless against flying or jumping enemies, although its high attack rate makes it somewhat effective against weaker fighter type enemies. Unless the player has a good reason to make the Shortsword (like not having very much Iron or for completionist purposes) they are advised to make the Iron Broadsword as it does more damage and can swing in an arc. At the creation of a Journey Mode character, the player will receive an Iron Shortsword to start off rather than the traditional Copper Shortsword. Its best modifier is Legendary.

It has a slower mining speed by one and mines Crimstone/Dungeon Bricks/Ebonstone/Hellstone/Pearlstone Blocks in one additional hit (4 instead of 3). The Nightmare Pickaxe, Deathbringer Pickaxe, Molten Pickaxe, and Reaver Shark are the only pre-Hardmode pickaxes able to mine Crimstone, Ebonstone, Hellstone and Obsidian. The Nightmare Pickaxe can only mine Dungeon Bricks that are at 0 depth or higher. 100% Pickaxe power (a Molten Pickaxe or better) is required to mine Dungeon Bricks in the Underground Dungeon.

=== 1.4.4 ===
Description: 1.4.4 "Labor of Love" Release date September 28, 2022 [1] Version chronology ← Previous Next → 1.4.3.6 1.4.4.1 Version history • All patches 1.4.4 is an update that focuses on balance and quality-of-life changes, but also includes a significant amount of new content. It was released on September 28, 2022. As the 1.4.4 update is highly focused on Quality of Life changes, there is naturally a substantial amount of overlap between some of these QoL changes and balance changes. It's impossible to draw an absolutely definitive line between the two categories, and so there are duplicate entries which are present both in this section and in the main changelog. Additionally, there are some particularly balance-impacting bugs which warrant being included in the balance section as well. For the sake of information being provided in the places where it is relevant, and given the significant length of the total changelog, we felt it was worth the extra clarity to include these changes in both sections of the changelog. 1.4.4 has the most extensive set of balance changes added in an update, even more so than 1.4 and 1.4.1; furthermore, it includes some of the most technically complicated changes made to weapons and other systems, including a number of reworks and other backend changes which alter the behavior of weapons beyond simple stat changes. Many of these changes delve into some of the more complex mechanics of Terraria's combat and weapon systems, and without taking all of these mechanics into play, some of the changes made may seem confusing, backwards, or unintuitive.

Description: Hellstone is an ore that can be found faintly glowing in The Underworld. It inflicts the Burning debuff on players who touch it. Items that protect the player from the debuff (including the Obsidian Skull and its derivatives) will allow players to touch it without incurring fire damage. NPCs and enemies do not receive damage from Hellstone. Mining it requires at least a Nightmare/Deathbringer Pickaxe (or Reaver Shark on ). Mining hellstone releases a half-tile of lava. It cannot be mined with explosives in pre-Hardmode. Hellstone tools are among the most powerful that can be acquired in pre-Hardmode, rivaled only by three tools that can be obtained from fishing: the Sawtooth Shark, Rockfish, and Reaver Shark.

Description: The Hellforge is a crafting station that incorporates the same functions as a regular Furnace, additionally being able to smelt Hellstone into Hellstone Bars.

On the PC version, Console version, Mobile version, and tModLoader version, Hellforges can only be collected with a Deathbringer or Nightmare Pickaxe or better (60% pickaxe power). Once placed at higher depths, they can be removed with any pickaxe. The Hellforge also functions as a Furnace.

=== Cursed Arrow ===
Description: Cursed Arrows are Hardmode arrows which apply the Cursed Inferno debuff on contact with an enemy. Unlike Flaming Arrows, they do not go out when they hit water. They are the Corruption counterpart to the Crimson's Ichor Arrows. As with most other arrows, Cursed Arrows have a chance not to break. When fired, they have a 16.67*1/6 (16.67%) chance to drop and can then be recovered. However, 66.67*2/3 (66.67%) of the time they will drop as a normal Wooden Arrow instead of a cursed one.

=== Angler Earring ===
Description: The Angler Earring is an accessory that provides a +10 boost to Fishing power when equipped. It is acquired as a 2.5*1/40 (2.5%)[1] chance reward for completing a Fishing quest for the Angler NPC. On the PC version, Console version, Mobile version, and tModLoader version, the Angler will not give you an Angler Earring as a reward if you already have one in your inventory or in any of your Portable Storages. Only one Angler Earring can be equipped at a time, however the increase in fishing power stacks with that of the Angler Tackle Bag and the Lavaproof Tackle Bag, granting a total boost of 30% if all three are equipped. Due to the aforementioned rule on duplicates for PC version, it could be beneficial to keep your Angler Earring in a chest, out of your possessions (inventory or portable storages), while keeping the other two in, to guarantee getting a second Angler Earring as soon as possible.

=== Ancient Horn ===
Description: The Ancient Horn is a Hardmode mount summoning item. When used, it summons a rideable Basilisk Mount which gives the player the ability to charge through enemies, damaging them in the process. In PC version, Console version, Mobile version, and tModLoader version, the Basilisk Mount can do an extra jump. It can be rarely (2% chance) dropped by the Basilisk. The Basilisk Mount provides accelerated land speed at 41 mph and provides increased jump height (14 tiles/28 feet), though is still hindered by water as usual. While mounted on the Basilisk, the player only takes 20% fall damage. If the Basilisk is moving at a speed of least 21 mph, running through enemies inflicts 90 base damage, not counting enemy defense. This damage is considered summon damage, meaning that minion-enhancing items will improve it. Enemies that are damaged by this attack do not inflict contact damage on the player, but the player will suffer contact damage from enemies that survive it, if the hitbox of the player gets hit. The Mount grants immumity to knockback. The Mount emits a faint red glow from 27' underground downwards. This light does not grow stronger as the player descends, and its color is unaffected by dyes.


=== Tin Bar ===

In addition to the usual flail mechanics, it has the unique ability to shoot petals toward enemies. It will launch the petals at a steady, rapid pace for as long as the ⚒ Use / Attack button is held and there are unobstructed targets to shoot at. Dropping the flail head to the ground mid-throw will cause the fire rate of its petals to increase drastically. Its best modifier is Godly or Demonic. Both modifiers increase the average damage output by the same amount.


=== Red Ryder ===
Description: The Red Ryder is a gun dropped from Presents obtained during Christmas, with a 0.643% chance in pre-Hardmode and 0.56% chance in Hardmode. It is similar to the Musket, although it does less damage. Its low speed and damage make it a very low-tier gun. However, it can potentially be obtained very early in the game, is better than most early-game bows, and it fulfills the criteria for the Arms Dealer to move in, making it an exceptional starting weapon. Its best modifier is Unreal.


=== Magma Snail ===
Description: The Magma Snail is a critter that spawns in The Underworld. It can be caught using the Lavaproof Bug Net or Golden Bug Net to be carried around in the inventory and released later, or crafted into a Magma Snail Cage to be placed as an animated furniture item.

=== Wooden Bow ===
Description: The Wooden Bow is the weakest bow in the game, dealing 4 base damage plus the damage of the arrow being fired. It is very cheap to make, and is therefore usually the first ranged weapon a player will acquire. Its best modifier is Demonic, as it does not have any knockback and thus cannot get modifiers that affect it. It can also get the Deadly modifier, which, while the Demonic modifier may provide the greatest damage per hit, grants a higher increase to the overall DPS.

=== Cannon ===
Description: The Cannon is an interactive furniture item purchased from the Pirate for 25. It can be placed on the ground and, when activated, either by a Player (consuming a Cannonball) or by wire (), fires an arcing cannonball that explodes on contact, dealing heavy damage without destroying blocks. The Cannon is powerful but immobile, functioning as a fixed gun emplacement, and so is best suited for tasks such as home defense. A more powerful version of the Cannon known as the Bunny Cannon is sold by the Pirate when the Party Girl is present and one Hardmode boss (Not including Queen Slime ) is defeated. Once placed, the angle of the Cannon can be adjusted by right-clicking either side of the Cannon to rotate it in that direction, or tapping the side of the cannon. There are 9 possible orientations and it cannot fire downward, though the arcing trajectory of the cannonballs can be used to hit targets below the emplacement. Each click/tap tilts the Cannon by one step (22.5°). The Cannon is fired by left-clicking it with a cannonball in hand, while pressing the Auto Select key with a cannonball in your inventory, or tapping the cannon with a cannonball in hand. In either case, the cannonball is consumed. On PC version, Console version, Mobile version, tModLoader version, and tModLoader 1.3-Legacy version, it can also be triggered by wire. Depending on where the wire is connected, it will either shoot a cannonball or rotate toward the side the wire is on. If triggered by wires the cannonballs will do no damage.

They are not suitable for NPC housing. In Old-gen console version, Windows Phone version, Old Chinese version, Nintendo 3DS version, and tModLoader 1.3-Legacy version, Crimstone Walls cannot be crafted by the player, but they can be converted from Stone Walls by using Red Solution sprayed with the Clentaminator. As the Clentaminator affects a rather large area, creating areas of localized Crimstone Walls without converting blocks and other wall parts may be difficult. In PC version, Console version, Mobile version, and tModLoader version, Crimstone Walls can be crafted from Crimstone Blocks at a Work Bench with Ecto Mist. Crimstone Walls can spread The Crimson to nearby pure walls. See Biome spread for further information.

=== Magnet Sphere ===
Description: The Magnet Sphere is a Hardmode, post-Plantera magic weapon that casts a glowing sphere where the player aims. It has a 0.33*1/300 (0.33%) / 0.67*1/150 (0.67%) chance to be obtained from the Blue Armored Bones, Rusty Armored Bones and Hell Armored Bones in the post-Plantera Dungeon. When cast, it fires a slow cyan sphere that travels in a straight line and zaps nearby enemies, unimpeded by liquid or other non-solid obstacles in its path. The sphere will rapidly shoot beams at the closest enemy as it travels through the air. It will disappear if the central orb has gone 52 tiles, or if it has been in the air for 15 seconds. If the player casts another sphere while there is already one in the air, the previous one will fade away. Its best modifier is Ruthless. The Mythical modifier provides the widest array of stat bonuses, but the only stats that improve damage output are damage and critical chance. Switching to a different magic weapon causes existing projectiles to use that weapon's critical chance instead, meaning that the Magnet Sphere's DPS is optimized with the Ruthless modifier when used in the intended way.


=== Seaweed ===
Description: Seaweed is a pet-summoning item which summons a Turtle pet that follows the player, like other pets.

=== Nail Gun ===
Description: The Nail Gun is a Hardmode, post-Plantera ranged weapon which has a 4*1/25 (4%) / 7.84*49/625 (7.84%) chance to drop from Nailhead during Solar Eclipses. It uses Nails as ammunition, which are sold by both the Merchant and the Arms Dealer when the player has the Nail Gun in their inventory for 1 each. When a Nail hits an enemy, it lodges in the target and does minor contact damage, delivering the remaining with a powerful, delayed explosion. The Nails also stick to surfaces and explode in the same manner. The explosion does not damage the user. Nails are unaffected by gravity until they have flown roughly 30 blocks, at which point they fly with an arc similar to that of an arrow. If used in PvP, the Nails will not stick to players and will instead deal damage somewhere in between the initial damage and the explosion's damage. Its best modifier is Demonic, as it does not have any knockback and thus cannot get modifiers that affect it. It can also get the Deadly modifier, which, while the Demonic modifier may provide the greatest damage per hit, grants a higher increase to the overall DPS.

It can fly in the air for 10 seconds before it enters a "tired" state, during which it slows and glides down. The glide can be accelerated using the ▼ Down key. Afterwards, it requires a 3-second rest period on the ground in order to begin flying at full speed again. If the player takes off again immediately after landing an exhausted bee, it will fly, but much slower than usual. Its rest period is indicated by a "heavy breathing" animation that stops when the Bee Mount is fully recovered.


=== Creeper Egg ===
Description: The Creeper Egg is a Hardmode summoning item that gives the player a Flickerwick light pet. It is dropped by the Ogre during the Old One's Army event.

=== Mud Bud ===
Description: The Mud Bud is a pet-summoning item sold by the Zoologist after defeating Plantera. It summons Plantero, a miniature version of Plantera, that follows the player. The pet keeps pace with the player by flying in a manner similar to Plantera's second form. The Plantera Seedling is a similar item; however, it is exclusive to Master Mode, and has a chance to be directly dropped by Plantera upon defeat, not to be confused with the Seedling, also dropped by Plantera after death, though it is available in Classic Mode.


=== Sandstorm in a Bottle ===
Description: The Sandstorm in a Bottle is an accessory found inside Gold Chests within Pyramids and Oasis/Mirage Crates. It is similar to the Cloud in a Bottle, providing a double-jump that allows for some extra height, but instead of a cloud beneath the feet, a sand jet appears and the character visually spins as they ascend on that jet. The Sandstorm jump goes 15 blocks into the air, totaling 21 blocks when put together with the first jump. This is nearly twice as high as the height achievable with the Cloud in a Bottle. It can also be crafted using Cloud in a Bottle with Forbidden Fragment using Crystal Ball.

=== Terraprisma ===
Description: The Terraprisma is a Hardmode, post-Plantera summon weapon. It spawns a copy of itself that rapidly attacks nearby enemies. It is a guaranteed drop from the Empress of Light when all damage dealt to the Empress occurs during the day. It is thought to be one of the hardest summon weapons to acquire in the game, as the Empress of Light will one shot the player with any attack during the day, but is also one of the best summons in the game due its unique and powerful attacks. Its best modifier is Ruthless. The Mythical modifier provides the widest array of stat bonuses, but these primarily affect the initial summon rather than the resulting minion. Additionally, minions cannot deal critical hits. The only lasting advantage a Mythical Terraprisma has over a Ruthless one is knockback.


=== Stardust Dragon Staff ===
Description: The Stardust Dragon Staff is a Hardmode, post-Lunatic Cultist summon weapon that summons a Stardust Dragon that attacks enemies. The Stardust Dragon constantly flies around the screen surrounding the player, and flies through blocks, attacking enemies by flying through them. It leaves a trail of sparkles that provide periodic bursts of light as it moves. The Stardust Dragon Staff is special in that if summoned more than once, multiple Dragons do not spawn — instead, the first spawned Dragon becomes longer by one segment for each additional summoning, broadening its area of attack and increasing its damage output. Each summon creates additional segments between the tail and the pre-tail segment, and re-summons the tail. The Stardust Dragon hits ten times per second. It inflicts damage according to the formula: summon dmg*(1.69 + .46[summon length - 1]), which is then all multiplied by a random multiplier between 0.85 and 1.15. Each segment of the dragon deals damage based on the damage modifier on the staff used to summon them, which means that different segments of the dragon can deal different damage. Its best modifier is Ruthless. The Mythical modifier provides the widest array of stat bonuses, but these primarily affect the initial summon rather than the resulting minion. Additionally, minions cannot deal critical hits. The only lasting advantage a Mythical Stardust Dragon Staff has over a Ruthless one is knockback.

When attacking using ⚒ Use / Attack, the lance will extend, and holding ⚒ Use / Attack will keep it extended at a fixed angle. The damage will increase depending on the player's movement speed, making mounts, sprinting accessories, or dash abilities (such as those granted by Shield of Cthulhu, Tabi/Master Ninja Gear, or Solar Flare armor) useful for maximizing damage. When the player takes damage, the Hallowed Jousting Lance will stop being active. Its best modifier is Godly or Demonic. Both modifiers increase the average damage output by the same amount.

The Hallowed Crate can only be obtained in Hardmode, but still drops separate pre-Hardmode loot when opened in a pre-Hardmode world. Hallowed Crates have a chance to drop Crystal Shards or Souls of Light in addition to other drops (only if opened in a Hardmode world, as per normal progression).

=== Worm ===
Description: The Worm is a Critter that spawns underground, or on the surface while raining. Worms also have a chance to spawn when the player breaks grass or stone or dirt piles, which causes them to fly out. Breaking larger rocks in the background has a high possibility of releasing worms. Worms can also be easily obtained by opening a Can Of Worms. They can be caught with a Bug Net and used as Bait for Fishing, and have 25% bait power. Like most Critters, they can also be released or crafted into a Worm Cage to be used as furniture. Worms (and their golden counterparts) will become stuck in 1-tile holes in the ground, which can allow for easy collection during rains. However this only works if both tiles adjacent to the worm are not hammered inclines. Due to how common fallen stars are, it is suggested that players upgrade worms in to Enchanted Nightcrawlers for use in fishing or selling

This stays true for harder blocks, such as Ebonstone and Crimstone. See the chart below for more details. Its best modifier is Light for harvesting purposes and Legendary for combat purposes.

It can be found rarely in Wooden Crates, or in Gold Chests, Frozen Chests, and other chests in the Underground and Caverns layers. Underground Cabins in the Underground Desert also have a chance to contain an Extractinator. To use the Extractinator, it first needs to be placed in the world. Afterward, suitable blocks need to be consumed (with the ⚒ Use / Attack key) directly on the Extractinator within its 3×3 frame. Holding the Auto Select key and clicking on the Extractinator will automatically insert extractable items from the player's inventory without having to pick them up manually. Feeding blocks to the Extractinator is the only way to obtain Amber Mosquitoes, and, along with opening crates, the only reliable way to obtain a world's alternative pre-Hardmode ores. This is a great way to obtain ore and coins in the early game.

A Blinkroot plant switches between its blooming and non-blooming state at random. Its blooming state can be identified by the yellow dots on the ends of its fronds and the blinking light it emits. Each plant will drop 1–3 Blinkroot Seeds when harvested while blooming. Blinkroot Seeds can be placed on bare Dirt and Mud Blocks, empty Clay Pots, or any types of Planter Boxes, and will grow into harvestable Blinkroots. They will grow anywhere, not just in the Underground, but will only yield seeds when blooming.


=== Ebonstone Brick ===

When a Mana Booster is picked up while the Mana Nebula buff is already in effect, it stacks with the previous Mana Nebula, for up to 3 stacked boosts.

Mana Boosters, like all Nebula boosters, float in the air and have a pickup range of approximately five tiles. They cannot legitimately appear in a player's inventory.


=== Frozen Slime Block ===
Description: Frozen Slime Blocks are blocks without any friction, making them more slippery than their constituent block, the Ice Block.

=== Iron Pickaxe ===
Description: The Iron Pickaxe is an early-game pickaxe that is stronger than the Copper and Tin Pickaxes, but weaker than the Silver and Tungsten Pickaxes. Compared to its alternate ore version, the Lead Pickaxe, it has less pickaxe power, deals 1 less damage, and is slightly slower in terms of mining speed.

=== Elf Melter ===
Description: The Elf Melter is a Hardmode ranged weapon dropped by Santa-NK1 during the Frost Moon. It is an indirect post-Plantera upgrade to the Flamethrower. Similar to its predecessor, one press of the ⚒ Use / Attack button fires several successive streams of flame, each of which inflicts the Frostbite debuff. The Elf Melter consumes one / two Gel per use. When an enemy is pierced by the projectile, a 15% damage penalty is applied to the next enemy hit by the projectile. Its best modifier is Unreal. A modifier granting +10% speed will increase the number of flame streams per click from six to seven while still consuming 2 Gel. A modifier with added velocity will increase the range of each stream, i.e. by about 5 blocks for +15% and about 3 blocks for +10%.


=== Blend-O-Matic ===
Description: The Blend-O-Matic is a hardmode crafting station that is purchased from the Steampunker for 10. It can be purchased at any time of day / only at night. Its sole purpose is to craft Asphalt Blocks which are used to run faster when walked on.


=== Arkhalis ===
Description: The Arkhalis is a rare melee weapon that appears to be a sword, but does not present an actual blade when used. Instead of an overhead broadsword swing or a shortsword stab, the Arkhalis autoswings and appears as a series of blurred slashes aimed in the direction of the cursor. Anything within this area takes constant damage at a rate far exceeding the weapon's stated use time. This damaging area has a rather wide spread, even attacking behind the player for a very short distance. On PC, Console, Mobile, and tModLoader, it is part of Arkhalis' set, and is only obtainable through Hardmode Treasure Bags in Expert Mode. It ignores up to 20 enemy defense. It has a weaker variant known as the Terragrim, which replaces it as a potential drop from Enchanted Sword Shrines. On Old Chinese and tModLoader Legacy, it is obtainable from the unique background object found in an Enchanted Sword Shrine or very rarely in the Caverns layer. This background object has a 33.33*1/3 (33.33%) chance to contain a "true" breakable sword item rather than a discolored "false" sword. When this item is broken, it has a 10*1/10 (10%) chance to drop the Arkhalis rather than an Enchanted Sword. This means that on average, the chance of an Enchanted Sword Shrine dropping an Arkhalis is 3.33*1/30 (3.33%). The sword that the item gives is determined at the time the background object is broken, so there is no way to determine which sword the player will be given.
