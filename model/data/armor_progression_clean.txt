Guide:Armor progression
This means the page will walk you through a specific task, strategy, or enemy/boss fight.

Progression in Terraria is marked by the player gaining access to new weapons, accessories, and armors. While weapons are the main determinant of combat effectiveness, armor also plays an important role by mitigating damage taken and passively boosting damage output.

Although simply choosing a tier-appropriate set of three matching armor pieces will typically be enough to beat the game, players seeking to optimize their loadouts for maximum offense or defense will often get better results from using mix-and-match hybrid sets. This guide will help you decide on which armor combinations to use at various points in game progression.

The armor listings within each section are in no particular order; sortable stat comparison charts are provided for those who want to maximize a particular stat. For stats on individual armor pieces, refer to armor stat table.

Stat overview

In most combat situations, the most beneficial armor stats are damage, critical strike chance, minion capacity, health regeneration, and defense.

Damage and critical strike chance are straightforward stats that boost the player's damage output. The optimal combination of total damage and critical chance is around 50/50, though enemy defense tilts the balance slightly in favor of damage. For simplicity, this guide assumes that both stats are equally valuable.

Minion capacity is often thought of as a class-specific stat. However, the autonomous nature of minions allows all classes to benefit from increased capacity. Even without investment in summon damage, a single minion can contribute a considerable amount of DPS, along with other potential benefits like attacking enemies coming from multiple directions, or stunlocking them.

Sentry capacity has similar offensive potential, but it is not as universally useful as minion capacity due to the stationary nature of sentries making them difficult to use outside of dedicated arenas.

Defense is a historically undervalued but useful stat that becomes even more useful on specialized tank builds, some of which are listed in this guide. To maximize the effectiveness of these sets, it's recommended to use defensive accessories reforged to Warding. As a rule of thumb, each point of defense is more effective than a 1% DPS boost when damage taken per hit is less than 50 / 75 / 100. While defensive builds are viable on higher difficulties, it will usually take heavier defense investment to reach the same level of effectiveness, and raw defense is unlikely to offer much protection from contact damage in the for the worthy and get fixed boi seeds.

Regeneration is a rare and highly desirable stat for armor to have. It is a more consistent source of survivability than defense, as it provides the same benefit regardless of how much damage the player takes per hit. For perspective, 2 HP/sec is equivalent to 80% of the total regeneration one would gain by using Greater Healing Potions on a 60 second cooldown.

Melee speed is a situational stat whose effectiveness depends entirely on the melee weapon that is being used. For most melee weapons that are capable of attacking at a distance, the only effect of melee speed is to increase the projectile velocity and/or range, with no effect on the actual attack rate. One significant exception is the Terra Blade, which does fire at a faster rate when melee speed increases, and therefore benefits greatly from melee speed investment. Swords that are mainly used for close-ranged combat like the Night's Edge and Keybrand also benefit from melee speed, although due to the increased risk to the player, it is typically better to run defensive investment instead.

Maximum mana and reduced mana usage can both be thought of as roundabout bonuses to magic DPS, as they both reduce the frequency that players will have to consume mana potions and therefore lessen the effect of Mana Sickness. However, since most magic weapons don't consume mana rapidly enough for Mana Sickness to be a serious hindrance, mana bonuses are usually less important than direct DPS bonuses, and mainly serve to improve quality-of-life when not using mana potions or magic buffs.

Movement speed is not worth investing in, even for players who highly value mobility. It only affects grounded movement speed, making it useless in Hardmode when players will be flying or mounted most of the time. In pre-Hardmode, movement speed bonuses are made obsolete by Hermes Boots and other movement accessories. While grounded movement can be useful in an arena made of Asphalt, running on Asphalt boosts speed by such an extreme degree that any additional movement speed bonuses become virtually unnoticeable.

Earlygame

At this point, armor serves little purpose other than to boost your defense. You may obtain up to 20 defense with metal armors such as Platinum armor, but obtaining these sets is time-consuming and usually unnecessary. It's perfectly fine to simply wear Ebonwood armor, Shadewood armor, or other basic, easy-to-craft armors until you can get your hands on a real armor set; whatever you wear at the start of the game will be replaced very quickly. More experienced players can save time by completely skipping armor in the early game, potentially even up to the Wall of Flesh battle.

Since there are no melee-specific armor sets at this stage, melee users are advised to use classless sets.

Seed-specific considerations:

Drunk world - Moon Lord Legs are available early on and can be worn on mixed sets as a mobility-based alternative to Jungle Pants, at the cost of 3 defense.
Celebrationmk10 - Wizard Hat provides an additional minion slot, increasing its offensive firepower compared to other magic armors.
Don't dig up - Ash Wood armor is available immediately (although with reduced defense) and can be worn to reduce damage from lava.
Get fixed boi - All of the above.

Early Hardmode

To save time and resources, it is recommended to prioritize turning Hardmode ores into pickaxes/drills, anvils, and forges to unlock Titanium or Adamantite as soon as possible, which will give you the best chances against your first mechanical boss. Until then, extra ores can be turned into individual armor pieces with the highest stats (typically head pieces) and deconstructed with Shimmer later on.

Pre-Plantera

Aside from Hallowed and Chlorophyte Bars, you now have access to the second tier of the Old One's Army, the rewards of which provide welcome upgrades to every class. Though the set bonuses of the Tavernkeep's armor sets are often too situational to be useful, many of the individual armor pieces have very high stats that make them optimal for hybrid sets.

Hallowed armor greatly increases the survivability of glass cannon loadouts, but is less effective than raw defense for pure tanking. Those who plan to use Spectre, Shroomite, or Beetle armor in the future can use Chlorophyte armor at this stage, and use Shimmer to deconstruct it into bars later.

Post-Golem (Old One's Army, Tier 2)

While Plantera and Golem provide separate advancements to game progression when defeated, they are treated as one milestone by this guide due to their similar difficulty level. At this point, players will likely be preparing to face Duke Fishron, Empress of Light, Martian Madness, and the Pumpkin Moon. The gear available at this stage is the minimum recommended gear for fighting the Moon Lord. For ranged users, the non-specific Adamantite Mask (or Hallowed Helmet) and weapon-specific Shroomite headpieces can be considered mostly interchangeable.

This section is mainly for players who are unable to efficiently clear the final tier of the Old One's Army due to not having planned for it in advance. Even without sentries, it should be possible to clear wave 5 to earn 15 medals, enough to buy a single tier 2 armor piece. Those who have stockpiled a large supply of Defender Medals prior to defeating Golem can skip to the next section.

With a good supply of Defender Medals in your pocket, you can purchase the best armor available before challenging the Lunar Events.

Endgame

All Luminite-tier armors are the best offensive armors for their respective classes (aside from Solar Flare armor, which offers a combination of offense and defense). However, the Valhalla Knight's Breastplate can still be worn by ranged users and summoners, who do not receive any defensive benefits from their respective endgame armors. Sentry-based hybrid sets are also viable due to the massive power of endgame sentry weapons.
