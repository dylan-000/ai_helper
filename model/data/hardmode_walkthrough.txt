# Guide: Walkthrough/Hardmode

This guide covers tasks, strategies, and enemy/boss fights for Hardmode.

## 1. Smashing Altars

- **Purpose:**  
  - Initiates Hardmode by generating new ores underground.
  - You must use the Pwnhammer to break Altars, which creates ore deposits more densely at lower depths.

- **Ore Generation Pattern:**  
  - **First Altar:** Spawns Cobalt or Palladium.  
  - **Second Altar:** Spawns Mythril or Orichalcum.  
  - **Third Altar:** Spawns Adamantite or Titanium.  
  - **Repeating Pattern:** Additional altars follow a diminishing returns pattern (smash 12 total for a repeat, then 33 total, etc.).

- **Additional Effects:**  
  - Each smashed altar may also create new blocks of Ebon/Crimstone or Pearlstone, causing respective biomes to spread.

- **Further Info:**  
  - See *Guide: Getting started with Hardmode*.

## 2. Mining Hardmode Ores

- **Preparation:**  
  - Once enough ore has spawned from smashed altars, begin mining Cobalt or Palladium with the Molten Pickaxe.

- **Notable Resource:**

- **Tip:**  
  - Generally avoid this biome unless you need Glowing Mushrooms or Mushroom Seeds.

---

## Additional Mining Tips

- **Alternate Ores:**  
  - If mining proves too dangerous in Hardmode biomes, consider looking for ores in the ceiling of the Underworld.
- **Upgrading Tools:**  
  - Upgrade quickly to a Cobalt or Palladium Drill (or their pickaxe equivalents).
  - Use early Mythril/Orichalcum ores to craft a Hardmode Anvil, then upgrade to a Mythril Drill/Pickaxe to access Adamantite/Titanium.
  - Use the first 30 Adamantite/Titanium ores to craft an Adamantite or Titanium Forge.

- **Chest Safety:**  
  - Always check chests for Mimics—shoot them from a distance to force them to reveal themselves.

- **Priorities:**  
  - Use leftover ore to upgrade armor, then weapons, and finally tools.

---

## The Goblin Army (Hardmode)

- **New Monster:**  
  - Goblin Summoner (casts highly damaging spells)
- **Drops:**  
  - Shadowflame Hex Doll, Shadowflame Knife, Shadowflame Bow
- **Recommended Equipment:**  
  - Armor: Adamantite/Titanium or better  
  - Weapons: Demon Scythe, Crystal Storm, Golden Shower  
  - Accessories: Lightning Boots, Wings
- **Tip:**  
  - Defeating the Goblin Summoner is key, as its drops (e.g., Shadowflame Bow) can inflict the Shadowflame debuff—crucial against mechanical bosses.

---

  - Pirate Deckhand, Pirate Deadeye, Pirate Corsair, Pirate Crossbower, Pirate Captain, Parrot, Flying Dutchman
- **Drops:**

  - Weapons such as Death Sickle, Chlorophyte Saber, Chlorophyte Partisan, Optic Staff, Golden Shower, Uzi, and Megashark
- **Trigger:**  
  - Can occur after smashing one demon altar or by using a Pirate Map.
- **Alerts:**  
  - A message will announce the approaching invasion (“Pirates are approaching from the East/West!”) and when they arrive (“The Pirates have arrived!”)
- **Tip:**  
  - Prepare your defenses in advance; early Hardmode Pirate Invasions can be challenging.

# The Great Run-up

Before facing the Mechanical bosses, complete these preparations while gathering ore for better gear:

- **NPC Housing:**  
  - Ensure you have a home for the Wizard.  
    - *Note:* The Wizard is found tied up underground (like the Goblin Tinkerer and Stylist) and is mandatory for magic users. He sells Greater Mana Potions and key crafting ingredients.

- **Stock Up on Potions:**  
  - Have a full set of buff potions ready.  
  - Carry at least a stack of Greater Healing Potions or Honeyfin.  
    - *Rationale:* The mech bosses’ damaging attacks will quickly reduce your health.

---

# Collecting Souls

Gathering souls is the final task before battling the Mechanical bosses. There are three types:

- **Soul of Flight:**  
  - **Source:** Dropped by Wyverns.  
  - **Tip:**  
    - Collect these first as they are used to craft wings, which are very useful for navigating Underground Hallow or Corruption.
  
  ## Floating Island (Hardmode)
  - **New Monsters:**  
    - Wyvern, Arch Wyvern  
  - **Drops:**  
    - Soul of Flight  
    - Shadow Key (from Arch Wyvern)  
  - **Recommended Equipment:**  
    - Adamantite or Titanium armor  
    - Piercing weapons (the Demon Scythe is particularly effective)  
    - Potions: Gravitation, Ironskin, and Regeneration Potions  
  - **Overview:**  
    - Wyverns fly quickly and deal high damage; use piercing weapons to hit their multiple segments.

- **Soul of Light:**  
  - **Source:** Dropped by enemies in the Underground Hallow (and some Underworld enemies that spawn below).  
  - **Tip:**  
    - Aim to gather at least 50 Souls.  
    - Farm spiders if your Hallow overlaps with a Spider Cave, taking advantage of their fast spawn rate.
  - **Further Info:**  
    - See *Guide: Harvesting Souls* for additional details.

- **Soul of Night:**  
  - **Source:** Dropped by enemies in the Underground Corruption and Crimson.  
  - **Tip:**  
    - Many of the same farming rules as for Souls of Light apply.
  - **Further Info:**  
    - See *Guide: Harvesting Souls* for more information.

# Miscellaneous Items

Collect these additional items to round out your preparations:

- **Pixie Dust:**  
  - Dropped by Pixies in the surface Hallow.  
  - **Uses:**  
    - Craft Greater Healing Potions or combine with Unicorn Horns to make Holy Arrows.

- **Dark and Light Shards:**  
  - **Source:**  
    - Mummies from the Corrupt/Crimson Desert drop Dark Shards.  
    - Mummies from the Hallowed Desert drop Light Shards.  
  - **Uses:**  
    - Collect these to craft the Dao of Pow.

- **Biome Keys:**  
  - **Source:**  
    - Extremely rare drop from enemies in six main biomes (Hallow, Corruption, Crimson, Jungle, Desert, and Snow).  
  - **Uses:**  
    - Open Biome Chests in the Dungeon after defeating Plantera for extremely powerful items.

- **Mimics:**  
  - **Tip:**  
    - Mimics can appear in almost any biome.  
    - Use Hunter Potions or a Lifeform Analyzer to locate them.  
    - Kill Mimics until you obtain a Philosopher's Stone and a Cross Necklace.
  - **Additional Note:**  
    - Fifteen Souls of Light or Night can craft Light or Night Keys, respectively.  
      - When placed into an empty chest, these keys create Hallowed or Corrupt/Crimson Mimics, which are larger, more dangerous, and offer unique rewards.
    - Hallowed, Corrupt, and Crimson Mimics may also appear naturally in their respective underground biomes.

Below is the reformatted walkthrough, organized into clear sections, headings, and bullet lists for improved readability:

# Queen Slime

**Overview:**  
- An optional yet fun boss whose drops aren’t required for progression.  
- Summoned by using a Gelatin Crystal (found in any hallowed biome’s Underground Hallow alongside Crystal Shards).

**Key Drops:**  
- **Crystal Assassin Armor Set:** The only set that boosts all types of damage.  
- **Hook of Dissonance:** Teleports you to the grappled location.  
- **Gelatinous Pillion:** Enhances airborne movement.  
- In Expert/Master mode, also drops **Volatile Gelatin** (automatically hurls bouncing slime balls at nearby enemies).

**Battle Characteristics:**  
- Similar to King Slime in ease because of limited movement and attacks.  
- Lacks rapid, long-range attacks; even in its second form, its movement is significantly slower than bosses like The Twins or Skeletron Prime.

---

# The Three Mechanical Bosses

Once you have amassed sufficient Hardmode resources, it’s time to prepare for and face the first three Hardmode bosses. Each is summoned using a specific item (crafted or dropped by enemies) or can sometimes spawn naturally at sunset (though proper preparation is key).

## Building a Hardmode Arena

**Solo Arena:**  
- Construct a long bridge of wood platforms (recommended 2500 platforms; minimum 1000).  
- Build it far above ground (ground should not be visible) and add blocks at each end to prevent falls.

**Team Arena:**  
- A shorter arena (250–500 platforms) with 2–3 separate rows, spaced for accessibility (e.g., with rocket boots).

**Reusable Arena Idea:**  
- Combine elements of your pre-Hardmode boss arena, the Old Ones Army arena, and your skybridge to reuse for events like King Slime/Eye of Cthulhu and wyvern fights.

**Additional Features:**  
- Consider adding Heart Statues and Star Statues on 1-second timers, along with Sunflowers, Heart Lanterns, Campfires, and pools of Honey to ease battles.

*Tip:*  
- If you’re not ready to build a new arena, you can repurpose your Wall of Flesh bridge for the first fight—but note that post-first Mechanical boss, additional spawns (Lava Bats, Red Devils) increase the challenge.

---

## Fighting the Mechanical Bosses

### The Destroyer

**Overview:**  
- The easiest mechanical boss, often the first to be tackled.  
- Can spawn naturally at sunset ("You feel vibrations deep below…") or be summoned using a Mechanical Worm at night.

**Stats:**  
- **Total Life:** 80,000 (shared among all segments)  
- **Defense:** Varies by segment (0 for head, 30 for body, 35 for tail)  
- **Damage:**  
  - Head: 60 (melee)  
  - Body: 40  
  - Tail: 20  
  - Death Laser: 22

**Mechanics:**  
- Uses worm AI; burrows and sweeps long passes.  
- Releases Probes when damaged (which drop hearts).

**Strategy:**  
- Use piercing and area-of-effect weapons.  
- Utilize hooks to escape traps formed by its body.  
- Wait for segments to be above ground when health is low.

**Additional Info:**  
- Does not despawn if using a Magic Mirror or Recall Potion; follows you—this can be useful for healing via a nearby Nurse.

---

### Skeletron Prime

**Overview:**  
- Hardmode version of Skeletron, with multiple arms and a head.  
- Alternates between attacking with different appendages and a spinning head attack.

**Stats (Approximate):**  
- **Head:** 25,000 Life (Defense: 25; 50 when spinning)  
- **Cannon:** 6,000 Life  
- **Saw:** 8,000 Life  
- **Vice:** 8,000 Life  
- **Laser:** 5,000 Life

**Damage:**  
- Varies by part; melee and grenade/laser damage also factor in.

**Strategy:**  
- Target and destroy arms (especially Prime Saw and Prime Vice) before focusing on the head.  
- Two methods to avoid attacks:  
  1. Use maximum running speed (Lightning/Frostspark Boots) and timed jumps.  
  2. Use Gravitation Potions to stay mobile.

---

### The Twins

**Overview:**  
- The most challenging of the three mechanical bosses; recommended to fight last.  
- Can spawn at sunset ("This is going to be a terrible night…") or be summoned with a Mechanical Eye at night.

**Individual Bosses:**  
- **Retinazer:**  
  - **Life:** 20,000; **Defense:** 10 (Stage 1), 25 (Stage 2)  
  - Attacks with lasers and charges; transforms when reaching low health.
- **Spazmatism:**  
  - **Life:** 23,000; **Defense:** 10 (Stage 1), 35 (Stage 2)  
  - Uses cursed flame attacks and charges; also transforms at low health.

**Battle Dynamics:**  
- They attack independently—sometimes one charges while the other uses its signature attack.  
- When a Twin reaches a certain health threshold, it enters a second stage with rapid-fire and more damaging melee attacks.
- The first defeated Twin yields no drops; drops appear when the second one is defeated.

**Strategy:**  
- Focus on one Twin at a time.  
- It’s advisable to kill Spazmatism first (as Retinazer’s stage one is less dangerous).  
- Use max speed (Lightning/Frostspark Boots) and timed jumps, or Gravitation Potions, to dodge charging attacks.
- Ensure you don’t let a Twin remain off-screen too long (on console/mobile, they may despawn—but you lose loot).

---

## Post-Mechanical Bosses & Additional Rewards

- Defeating any Mechanical boss unlocks new challenges and grants access to materials like souls and Hallowed Bars.  
- Hallowed Bars are used to craft Hallowed armor and various weapons.  
- You can return to the Underground Jungle to farm Life Fruit (increases max health to 500).

---

## Duke Fishron

**Overview:**  
- One of the hardest bosses in the game (as of version 1.3.3.3).  
- Requires capturing a Truffle Worm (a challenging process due to low spawn rates) to summon him by fishing in the Ocean.

**Stats & Drops:**  
- **Life:** 50,000  
- **Defense:** 50  
- **Damage:** 100 (melee)  
- **Key Drops:**  
  - Flairon, Tsunami, Razorblade Typhoon, Tempest Staff, Bubble Gun, Fishron Wings, Shrimpy Truffle (Expert mode)

**Recommended Equipment (By Class):**  
- **Melee:** Turtle/Beetle armor, Possessed Hatchet, Vampire Knives  
- **Ranged:** Shroomite armor, Chain Gun or Tactical Shotgun with Chlorophyte Bullets, or Stynger  
- **Magic:** Spectre armor (Hood), Heat Ray, Bat Scepter, Golden Shower (plus Celestial Cuffs, Sorcerer Emblem/Celestial Stone)  
- **Accessories (All Classes):**  
  - Hoverboard (or Wings), Frostspark Boots, Amphibian Boots, Destroyer Emblem, Tabi/Master Ninja Gear, Shield of Cthulhu (Expert mode)

**Buff Potions (All Classes):**  
- Ironskin, Regeneration, Swiftness, Thorns, Water Walking, Well Fed, Wrath, Rage, Lifeforce, Endurance, Summoning, (optional) Gravitation

**Battle Strategy:**  
- Duke Fishron’s second stage is lethal—avoid stopping movement at all costs.  
- Running while continuously firing is key; keep your distance.  
- Gravitation Potions can maximize mobility but may be disorienting; Wings and Frostspark Boots offer reliable ground mobility.
- The Tabi/Master Ninja Gear assists in dodging; Shield of Cthulhu (if timed well) can absorb his lunging attacks.
- Avoid leaving the Ocean biome—if you do, his defense and attack double.
- It’s best to build a flexible arena with platforms over the Ocean biome.

**Additional Tips:**  
- Duke Fishron is challenging but generally easier than Lunar Events.  
- If you repeatedly fight him, his weapon drops and wings will ease subsequent battles.
- For more strategies, see *Guide: Duke Fishron strategies*.
