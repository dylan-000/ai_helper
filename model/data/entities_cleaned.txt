Description:
The Cursed Skull (and the Dragon Skull on Old-gen console, Windows Phone, and 3DS) is a flying enemy found only in the Dungeon. It is similar to the Meteor Head, with high damage, slow speed, and the ability to travel through tiles.

When striking a player, the Cursed Skull has a decent chance to apply the Cursed debuff. This renders the player unable to use items, including Weapons, Potions, and Grappling Hooks, making it very difficult to avoid further damage. They are much more likely to appear in Dungeon areas where there are Brick Walls.

Most varieties of Jellyfish produce light, making them easy to spot in dark areas. There are currently 5 Jellyfish variants, 3 of which only appear during Hardmode. Blue Jellyfish only spawn in pre-Hardmode and are replaced by the Green variant in Hardmode. In Expert Mode, Jellyfish will periodically become electrified, making them invincible for the duration of the attack. If the player attacks a Jellyfish with a sword while it is electrified (or any other swung item that deals direct damage, such as most tools), the player will be hurt. A Jellyfish will constantly maintain its speed while electrified unless it comes into contact with a wall or the water's surface.

King Slime spawns under one of the following conditions: Fighting King Slime is completely optional and not required for game progression, but his defeat may reward the player with money and useful items.

Salamanders, Crawdads, and Giant Shellies are tied into the same mechanic: any given world will only have two of the three enemy types. As such, a world with both Crawdads and Giant Shellies will not have Salamanders. In PC version, Console version, Mobile version, and tModLoader version, this is taken into account by the Bestiary progression logic, and the missing enemy will register as unlocked when the other two exclusive creatures are unlocked.

Name: Slimes

Stats:

Description:
Slimes are the most common enemy type. They are almost always the first enemy the player encounters in a new world. They come in multiple sizes and colors, each with different health, defense, and damage. With the exception of the Gastropod, winged Slimer, and Hoppin' Jack, all slimes follow the basic Slime AI: They hop in the direction of the player and rest a short amount of time afterwards. When a slime is preparing to hop, it bobs up and down rapidly. Slimes can float in water and move significantly faster while doing so, but only the Lava Slime can float in lava. Slimes spawned on or near the surface are usually neutral and do not chase the player during the day, unless provoked. All slimes become hostile at night and slimes spawned underground are always hostile. Green, Blue, Red, Purple, and Yellow Slimes usually spawn on or near the surface, while Mother Slime, Baby Slime, and Black Slime can only be found underground. Pinky may appear anywhere, yet rarely. Similar to Pinky, the Golden Slime may appear anywhere rarely, but only in Celebrationmk10 worlds. Most types drop 1-2 Gel, with exceptions noted in the table below. Most slime types also have a very small chance of dropping a Slime Staff: Certain slimes have a 5*1/20 (5%) chance of carrying a bonus item when spawning naturally. This item can be seen inside the slime's body and will drop upon its death. The slimes that can have bonus drops are: The bonus drops cannot be seen inside Pinky's body, although they do still drop. Slimes spawned from statues can never carry a bonus drop. Dungeon Slimes will always have a Golden Key as a bonus drop.

Name: Mimics
Type: Enemy

Stats:

Description:
Mimics are rare Hardmode enemies disguised as chests, appearing as the appropriate chest type for the environment. Mimics can be spawned by the player using the Chest Statue, even prior to Hardmode. However, Mimics spawned this way only drop the Mimic Banner. Mimics can also spawn naturally prior to Hardmode in worlds with the Remix Seed. Rare Hallowed, Corrupt, and Crimson Mimics can also be spawned manually by players via a Key of Light or Key of Night (see the Biome Mimic section below). Ordinary Mimics look like chests until approached or attacked, at which point they come to life and chase the player by hopping towards them. Before revealing themselves, they take on the appearance of chests normally found in the biome they are encountered in: regular Chests above the Underground layer, Gold Chests Underground, and locked Shadow Chests in The Underworld. Mimics that spawn in a Snow biome on ice or snow take on the appearance of Frozen / Ice Chests and also have their own unique set of ice-themed drops. These Mimics are rarer, and much more powerful in every way, than the normal Mimics (they are even more deadly than any pre-Hardmode boss, with the possible exception of the Wall of Flesh). They only spawn in the vicinity of the underground version of their corresponding biome. Each type has its own set of unique drops, including powerful early Hardmode weapons and tools. Like ordinary Mimics, they only spawn in Hardmode worlds. The Jungle variant spawns only in Celebrationmk10 and Get fixed boi worlds. On the Old Chinese version and tModLoader 1.3-Legacy version, it is unimplemented and never spawns during normal gameplay. Similar to ordinary Mimics, these special variants disguise themselves as "Chests" until approached or attacked, but they do not resemble any Chest type currently in the game, and are significantly larger than ordinary Chests. Hallowed, Corrupt, and Crimson Mimics can also be summoned manually by the player, in Hardmode worlds only, by placing a Key of Light or a Key of Night inside an otherwise empty Chest; the Chest becomes a Mimic once it is closed. Note that this does not work using other storage items, such as Dressers. The natural evil biome of the current world determines whether a Corrupt or a Crimson Mimic is summoned via the Key of Night. All four special Mimics have the same attack patterns: The Jungle Mimic has an additional "attack" called the "stuff cannon", which consists of hurling 10 of the following blocks (in "dropped form") at the player: While disguised, Mimics will not show a usual enemy tooltip when hovering the mouse cursor over them. Below are some tips to help differentiate real chests from Mimics.

The Goblin Warlock (Goblin Summoner on Old Chinese and tModLoader Legacy) is an enemy that can spawn when a Goblin Invasion occurs during Hardmode. She summons Shadowflame Apparitions to attack the player. She can be considered a mini-boss, since she drops significant weapon upgrades at the beginning of Hardmode and involves a lengthy fight with multiple attack patterns. She has a chance to drop weapons which are themed after Shadowflame, all of which accordingly inflict the Shadowflame debuff. Because of her high stats and relatively high difficulty compared to other goblins, she will present a challenge for new players. On the PC version, Console version, Mobile version, and tModLoader version, it is one of the few entities that can be detected by the Lifeform Analyzer or its upgrades.

Jellyfish are enemies found in water. When underwater, they attack by propelling themselves towards the player in short bursts. When outside of water, they will be unable to move or pursue the player in any way. Jellyfish are able to jump out of the water to attack players, often leaving them stranded on land. Most varieties of Jellyfish produce light, making them easy to spot in dark areas. There are currently 5 Jellyfish variants, 3 of which only appear during Hardmode. Blue Jellyfish only spawn in pre-Hardmode and are replaced by the Green variant in Hardmode. In Expert Mode, Jellyfish will periodically become electrified, making them invincible for the duration of the attack. If the player attacks a Jellyfish with a sword while it is electrified (or any other swung item that deals direct damage, such as most tools), the player will be hurt. A Jellyfish will constantly maintain its speed while electrified unless it comes into contact with a wall or the water's surface.

Description:
The Kobold is an enemy only found in tiers 2 and 3 of the Old One's Army event, spawning from the Mysterious Portal. When it gets near the player or Eternia Crystal, it will show a speech bubble with an exclamation mark, light its fuse, and begin dashing towards the nearest target. When it reaches a target or its fuse time runs out, it will detonate, damaging any target caught in the explosion. The detonation will not destroy tiles, similarly to the Grenade. Like other members of the Old One's Army, if a Kobold's target is too far away or obstructed, it will enter an ethereal state, allowing it to float upwards and pass through tiles. Kobolds are also unaffected by Teleporters or Lava, and will take half damage from Traps. The Kobold requires 200 kills to be awarded with its corresponding banner, as opposed to the usual 50 kills.

Stats:

• Defense: 15

Description:
The Cat is a town pet. It arrives at dawn (4:30 AM) the day after the player uses the Cat License, which is purchased from the Zoologist for 5. The Cat does not count towards the NPCs' "crowded" limit and hence will not affect NPC happiness, although it does count as a regular town NPC for the purpose of the Pylon network. There are six breeds of Cat, with one randomly being chosen when it arrives. The only requirements for the Cat to appear is the use of a Cat License and the presence of a valid house. The Cat's house can be changed, as with any other NPC, however the Cat can share the same house as another NPC. The Cat needs a 2-tile floor space to sleep on occasionally; it may not move into a house if that space is not available. The Cat can be talked to with the ⚷ Interact button, like any other town NPC. It will offer a "Pet" option, which places the player directly in front of the Cat when selected, and displays an animation of them petting the Cat, an effect that is a purely visual. It only works if there are at least two flat tiles on the same level as the Cat in front of it. Using any item, taking damage, or closing the dialogue window terminates the animation. Like the Angler, the status message displayed when the Cat is killed is "<name of Cat> has left!". It will respawn within the next days, and may respawn as a different breed. The Town Cat may have any of the following names:

Description:
The Destroyer is a Hardmode mechanical boss which is essentially a more difficult version of the Eater of Worlds. Like the Eater of Worlds, it is a very large worm. Although it appears to be similarly made up of many segments, individual segments cannot die, and The Destroyer will not split apart into multiple entities; its segments share a singular health pool. Like other worms, The Destroyer takes increased damage from attacks that damage multiple segments at once. The Destroyer can be summoned manually using a Mechanical Worm at night (7:30 PM to 4:30 AM). It also has a 10*1/10 (10%) chance to spawn naturally at dusk once a Demon or Crimson Altar has been destroyed, as long as it has not yet been defeated at least once in the current world. If spawning this way, its arrival is announced by the status message "You feel vibrations from deep below...". Each of The Destroyer's segments fires lasers at the player. The red-lit segments contain a Probe, which is an independent flying enemy that is launched periodically as the boss takes damage and also fires lasers. Probes can be killed individually once detached, and never return to The Destroyer. The Destroyer must be killed before dawn, otherwise it flees and despawns. While The Destroyer is alive, the music Boss 3https://terraria.fandom.com/wiki/File:Music-Boss_3.mp3 will play.

While climbing on walls, The Possessed seems to have an increased movement speed, similar to the other enemies that share this wall-climbing trait, and a 100% resistance to knockback.[1] Additionally, it has been repeatedly observed that the Possessed can build up enough momentum to move at blinding speeds. Rarely, this can result in The Possessed phasing through obstacles such as walls or doors.

Description:
The Dryad is an NPC vendor that will spawn once the following criteria have been met: In addition to selling items, the Dryad can also report the percentages of Corruption/Crimson and Hallow that exist in the current world. On the PC version, Console version, Mobile version, Old Chinese version, tModLoader version, and tModLoader 1.3-Legacy version, when enemies are nearby, the Dryad will periodically grant the Dryad's Blessing buff to players and other town NPCs in the vicinity and displays a leaf barrier effect. The buff grants +8 defense to players and +6 / +10 / +14 defense to town NPCs, increased health regeneration, and gives the player (and town NPCs) a Thorns effect. Enemies within the leaf barrier and with clear sight to the Dryad will be inflicted with the Dryad's Bane debuff, which will deal 4+ damage per second (plus various progression-based damage boosts, and all multiplied by 1× / 1.5× / 1.75×); the minimum damage dealt by the Dryad's Bane debuff is 4 / 6 / 7 per second. The Dryad's reports on Corruption/Crimson/Hallow coverage are accompanied by a status message. She sees Hallow as "good", and Corruption or Crimson as "bad". The Dryad makes the distinction between Corruption and Crimson if they are present in the same world, and will list their percentages separately, though they both contribute to the overall "bad" total in her final report. The status report is not updated live.Verify This is presumably to reduce the slowdowns that could be caused by constantly searching through the millions of blocks in a Terraria world. The report can be manually updated by leaving and re-joining the world. For more information, see NPC happiness. When submerged in Shimmer, the Dryad will transform into her Shimmered form. This has no impact on gameplay or dialogue and is only a visual change. She can be returned to her classic look by submerging her in Shimmer again. The Dryad may have any of the following names:

Description:
The Desert Spirit is a Hardmode enemy that can be found in Corrupted or Crimson Underground Desert biomes. Desert Spirits have an attack pattern that is unique compared to most enemies. Upon appearing near a player, they will cast a single, colored projectile that attempts to home in on the nearest player, phasing through blocks and slowly gaining speed. After a certain amount of time, it will duplicate and explode. Similar to other casters, it will then teleport to a different location and repeat the process. It should be noted that the projectiles themselves do not deal any damage, but their explosions do. The Desert Spirit drops the Desert Spirit Lamp with a 2.5*1/40 (2.5%) chance, or the Djinn's Curse with a 3.33*1/30 (3.33%) chance, but never both. The Desert Spirit Lamp is rolled first, and if not dropped, the Djinn's Curse is rolled.[1]

The bulbs can be broken in various ways including: with a pickaxe or drill, with Dynamite, with lava, or if the Jungle grass underneath them is removed, e.g. via biome spread, actuating the blocks, or the Clentaminator.

Description:
The Goblin Tinkerer is an NPC that sells several unique items, as well as providing the Reforge function. He can be acquired after a Goblin Army has been defeated, spawning randomly in open areas in the Cavern layer (Underground layer in the Don't Dig Up and Everything seeds.) He will appear to be bound at first, and like the Mechanic, Wizard, Golfer, Tavernkeep, Angler, and Stylist, talking to him in this state will free him. He will then respawn as long as a vacant House is available. The Goblin Tinkerer's reforge option allows the player to randomize the Modifier for a weapon or accessory, which can make the item better or worse than it was originally. Reforges cost one-third of the item's current value, which can also be affected by its current modifier. The reforge cost is also affected by the Goblin Tinkerer's Happiness, and can be decreased by equipping a Discount Card or Greedy Ring.[2] The modifiers of items used in crafting have no effect on the crafted item's modifier. Any modifier given to the newly crafted item will be completely random. On the PC version, Console version, Mobile version, Old Chinese version, tModLoader version, and tModLoader 1.3-Legacy version when threatened by enemies, the Goblin Tinkerer will defend himself by throwing Spiky Balls, which behave like those thrown by the player and deal 15 / 22 / 26 damage at the start of the game, and (on the PC version, Console version, Mobile version, and tModLoader version) as players progress he will gain various stat increases.[1] The Goblin Tinkerer prefers to be in the Cavern layer or with the Mechanic. The Bound Goblin is one of the few entities that can be detected by the Lifeform Analyzer or its upgrades. For more information, see NPC happiness. When submerged in Shimmer, the Goblin Tinkerer will transform into his Shimmered form. This has no impact on gameplay or dialogue and is only a visual change. He can be returned to his classic look by submerging him in Shimmer again. The Goblin Tinkerer may have any of the following names:

Description:
The Brain of Cthulhu is a pre-Hardmode, Crimson-themed boss resembling a large, flying brain. It can be summoned when 3 Crimson Hearts are destroyed in a Crimson world, or when a player uses a Bloody Spine anywhere in The Crimson or Underground Crimson biome. The Brain of Cthulhu has two stages. In the first, the Brain is invulnerable and teleports randomly around the player. 20 Creepers spawn along with the Brain and orbit the boss at high speed. Creepers do not respawn once they are killed. All Creepers must be destroyed first before the Brain of Cthulhu enters its second phase, where it becomes vulnerable to attack and can be killed. Defeating the Brain of Cthulhu and its attendant Creepers is the only way to obtain Tissue Samples, and is one of the ways to obtain usable quantities of Crimtane Ore. Defeating the Brain of Cthulhu for the first time allows the Tavernkeep NPC to spawn. The Brain of Cthulhu is the Crimson counterpart to the Eater of Worlds. Unlike its Corruption counterpart, it does not have a mechanical equivalent in Hardmode. While the Brain of Cthulhu is alive, the music Boss 3https://terraria.fandom.com/wiki/File:Music-Boss_3.mp3 will play. When Otherworldly music is enabled, the track Boss 1 (Otherworldly)https://terraria.fandom.com/wiki/File:Music-Boss_1_(Otherworldly).mp3 will play instead. The Brain itself is initially invincible. It teleports around the player, drawing nearer before teleporting away again in a random direction while its Creeper minions attack the player. The Creepers do not teleport along with the Brain but are instead pulled between the player and the Brain in large, sweeping orbits, forming groups and allowing the player to deal damage to all the Creepers at the same time. Once all Creepers are defeated, the Brain enters its second phase. In the second phase, the Brain becomes vulnerable to attacks and knockback and it aggressively attempts to ram the player while rapidly teleporting around.

The Tavernkeep is a unique NPC vendor that accepts only Defender Medals as currency for most items, instead of coins. He will only become accessible after the player has defeated the Eater of Worlds or Brain of Cthulhu. Once this criteria is met, he will appear as an Unconscious Man spawning in any layer of the world. Similar to other bound NPCs, talking to him allows him to claim a house and respawn when killed. The Tavernkeep's sentry summon weapons are associated with the Old One's Army event, and at first can only be used within that event. They function elsewhere only after the event is completed once successfully. Each of the Tavernkeep's sentry summon weapons come in three tiers: rod, cane, and staff, with the staff being the most expensive and the most powerful. The armor he sells also associates each sentry type with a specific class: Ballista for melee (tank-style), Flameburst for magic, Explosive for rangers, and Lightning Aura for "speedy melee" (for summoners). The Tavernkeep will give each player 5 medals for free, to buy their first sentry; all future medals must be earned by defeating at least some waves of the Old One's Army. When threatened, he throws mugs of Ale at enemies, dealing 24 / 36 / 42 damage at the start of the game, and (on the PC version, Console version, Mobile version, and tModLoader version) as players progress he will gain various stat increases.[1]. On all versions he may also drop an Ale Tosser upon death, allowing the player to perform the same attack. The Unconscious Man is one of the few entities that can be detected by the Lifeform Analyzer or its upgrades. For more information, see NPC happiness.

Description:
Giant Fungi Bulbs are Hardmode enemies found in Glowing Mushroom biomes both above and below the surface. They act similar to Man Eaters and Snatchers, but have a longer reach and launch Fungi Spores towards the player, dealing high damage. Fungi Spores fly towards their target, passing through blocks, and glide downward in a serpentine pattern. They can be destroyed by one hit with any weapon or damage-inflicting tool.

Name: Crawltipede
Type: Flying Enemy, Burrowing Enemy

Stats:
• Environment: Lunar Events
• Max Life: 10000/20000/30000

Description:
The Crawltipede is a Hardmode, post-Lunatic Cultist, worm-like enemy which spawns in Solar Pillar areas during the Lunar Events. Uniquely, it has no health bar, and instead can only be destroyed by damaging its tail, which can be difficult to hit. It flies directly at airborne players and deals high damage, while ignoring players on the ground. Something to note is that while its health may be very high and its tail can be hard to hit, the Crawltipede takes significantly more damage from all attacks than it should, as if it had a high multiplier for damage taken. This makes killing it easier than one might think, though still sometimes difficult. The Crawltipedes' primary role seems to be forcing the player to stay near the ground, opening them up to melee attacks from the other invasion enemies.

Wyverns are large Hardmode enemies that spawn in Space. They resemble Chinese dragons, are long and white, and follow the Worm AI. Arch Wyverns are the bronze-colored Old-gen console, Windows Phone, and 3DS-exclusive variants. They will follow descending players down to ground level, and can fly through blocks, but regular Wyverns tend not to fly below ground. Wyverns will only spawn when the player is above a certain altitude (see Space § Notes). Outside of the Crimson, Corruption, and Dungeon biomes, and except during events, having at least one NPC near the player will also prevent them from spawning. A Wyvern will not spawn if another one is already alive, and like most enemies able to pass through blocks, it will not be able to spawn if the player themselves stays in front of player-placed walls, even if there are valid spawn points for the Wyvern.

Description:
The Eater of Souls is a flying enemy found prominently in the Corruption. It is the Corruption counterpart to the Crimson's Crimera. Eaters of Souls spawn from both Ebonstone, Corrupt grass, Ebonsand, Ebonsandstone (if on surface), Hardened Ebonsand (also if on surface), and Purple Ice. with large groups coming from chasms. They circle the player at a distance before periodically rushing in. There are three size variants, each with corresponding amounts of health, defense, and damage. The Eater of Souls is the primary reason that newer players will want to avoid the Corruption prior to becoming more familiar with game combat, and acquiring more powerful weapons or armor. Eaters have relatively high defense and health points, cause significant damage on contact, and usually attack in swarms. A fourth Eater-type enemy, the Corruptor, appears after entering Hardmode, and is larger than the large-size Eater.

Description:
Pumpking is a Hardmode, post-Plantera mini-boss that spawns during the Pumpkin Moon event. It is the event's final enemy, and it is the only enemy besides Poltergeist that can consistently travel through blocks. Up to seven of them (more in Multiplayer) can attack simultaneously during the event's final wave (wave 15). Pumpking has two arms, each possessing a large scythe that periodically fires erratic projectiles. The hands otherwise act much like Skeletron's hands, swiping at the player to inflict melee damage, but unlike Skeletron, Pumpking's hands cannot take damage. Like Mourning Wood, the later the Pumpkin Moon wave that Pumpking is killed in, the more likely it is to drop items. A Pumpking defeated during Wave 15 is guaranteed to produce one Pumpking Trophy along with one other item in its drop table. Defeating a Pumpking will add 150 points to the Pumpkin Moon event, giving the most number of points for any enemy in the event.

Name: The Torch God

Stats:

Description:
The Torch God is an event that is initiated by clustering a large number of Torches underground, below the Surface layer. It consists of dodging projectiles, and survivors are rewarded with the Torch God's Favor, an item that gives the player the option for their Torches to automatically match the biome they are in. Making sure Torches match the biome type they are in will positively influence the player's luck in most areas. The event can begin once at least 101 Torches of any type are placed in close proximity below the Surface layer in any biome. It is possible for the event to start with less than 101 torches placed if the player is moving, due to the game's calculation incorrectly counting some Torches more than once. The Torch God will not begin for any character who has already consumed the Torch God's Favor or has one in their inventory. As the Torch God begins, Dangerous torch flames shoot off at the player as projectiles, one at a time. They are fired randomly, at a rate of three per second. The fireballs deal 40 / 80 / 120 base damage,[1]and pass through blocks to reach the player. After passing the player, they do collide with blocks, however. Each Torch shoots one fireball and extinguishes itself afterward as if it was switched off via wire. For the entire duration of the event, the player is inflicted with the Blackout debuff, significantly reducing their vision. The Torch God ends once all nearby Torches have been spent, to a maximum of 200 attacks. If at least 95 Torches are fired, the player is rewarded with the Torch God's Favor item.[1] All Torches re-light when the event ends. If the player dies or leaves the area, the event ends early and nothing is awarded. While the event is active, the music Boss 3https://terraria.fandom.com/wiki/File:Music-Boss_3.mp3 will play.

The Eye of Cthulhu is a pre-Hardmode boss. It is one of the first bosses a player may encounter, as it spawns automatically when a relatively early level of game advancement is achieved.

It also has a 33.33*1/3 (33.33%) chance of spawning automatically each night, if the following conditions apply: If spawning this way, its arrival is announced by the status message "You feel an evil presence watching you...". If the player is sufficiently far underground, the Eye of Cthulhu will not spawn until they return to the Surface. If they remain underground all night, the boss will not spawn at all.

Drops:
• Bone Key100%

Description:
The Dungeon Guardian is an enemy resembling Skeletron's head that guards the Dungeon against intruders. If a player enters the Dungeon in a world where Skeletron has not been defeated and travels below zero depth (a horizontal invisible border separating the surface from the underground), one or more Dungeon Guardians quickly fly at the player, dealing 1000/2000/3000 damage each, which will instantly kill most players if they are unprepared. Dungeon Guardians are large, very fast (traveling at around 41 mph in all directions), and travel through all blocks. Any player who attacks a Dungeon Guardian, regardless of the weapon or other equipment (with very few exceptions), will deal only 1 damage, or 2 for critical hits. This means that the Dungeon Guardian will normally take an average of 1.04 damage. While killing a Dungeon Guardian is possible (and will award the Bone Key pet summon), it requires careful preparation. See the Tips section for setups. The Dungeon Guardian's Bestiary entry will automatically fill itself out if Skeletron is defeated. Because of the extreme effort that has to be taken to defeat a Dungeon Guardian, and because its only drop, the Bone Key, is a purely cosmetic item, defeating a Dungeon Guardian is pointless from a practical perspective. (On the Old-gen console version, the Bone Key is required for the "Pet Hoarder" achievement.) Most of the following tips assume taking a late-game or endgame character to a fresh world where the Guardian can still be summoned, as they involve items that can only be obtained after defeating Skeletron (if not the Moon Lord). In order to quickly reach the surface after spawning the Dungeon Guardian, a player can dig a shaft into the Dungeon, flying up as soon as reaching zero depth. The Depth Meter or its upgrades are almost mandatory to avoid being caught off-guard. In multiplayer, it can simply be lured out by another player. In Expert Mode or Master Mode Dungeon Guardians have no mode-exclusive drop, but they do have double (triple) the health (and damage). Due to this, it is simplest to fight the Dungeon Guardian on a Classic world to save time, money, and further troubles. Weapons with a high rate of fire or splash damage are preferable, in order to compensate for the reduced damage. Damage per hit is nearly irrelevant for this fight, as any weapon hit gets reduced to 1 or 2 points of damage. However, high critical chance is crucial, as critical hits can tremendously speed up the fight. Viable options include: Since the Dungeon Guardian moves at 41 mph, having high mobility is essential. The UFO (41 mph), or Unicorn Mounts (61 mph) are suitable, and many types of wings reach speeds above 41 mph, especially when the Soaring Insignia is combined with hovering wings. A Rod of Discord may help with turning around at the world's edge. Before 1.4.1.1, the Pirate Ship Mount traveled 82 mph horizontally, as opposed to the current 36 mph horizontally, which was especially effective at outrunning the Dungeon Guardian. Frost armor is highly recommended for ranged and melee users because Dungeon Guardian is not immune to Frostburn debuff. Equipping full Titanium armor can allow a player to occasionally dodge otherwise lethal hits. Accessories offering dodge abilities can likewise help. One complex but effective way to kill the Dungeon Guardian is to lure it into a circular hoik and throw a boomerang, effectively preventing it from reaching the player while it will constantly be taking damage from the boomerang. Purchasing teleporters from the Steampunker NPC and laying them out apart from each other can be a viable strategy. Similarly, the Portal Gun can be used such that the player is always teleporting, which will make it nearly impossible for the Dungeon Guardian to hit them.

Name: Mimics
Type: Enemy

Stats:

Description:
Mimics are rare Hardmode enemies disguised as chests, appearing as the appropriate chest type for the environment. Mimics can be spawned by the player using the Chest Statue, even prior to Hardmode. However, Mimics spawned this way only drop the Mimic Banner. Mimics can also spawn naturally prior to Hardmode in worlds with the Remix Seed. Rare Hallowed, Corrupt, and Crimson Mimics can also be spawned manually by players via a Key of Light or Key of Night (see the Biome Mimic section below). Ordinary Mimics look like chests until approached or attacked, at which point they come to life and chase the player by hopping towards them. Before revealing themselves, they take on the appearance of chests normally found in the biome they are encountered in: regular Chests above the Underground layer, Gold Chests Underground, and locked Shadow Chests in The Underworld. Mimics that spawn in a Snow biome on ice or snow take on the appearance of Frozen / Ice Chests and also have their own unique set of ice-themed drops. These Mimics are rarer, and much more powerful in every way, than the normal Mimics (they are even more deadly than any pre-Hardmode boss, with the possible exception of the Wall of Flesh). They only spawn in the vicinity of the underground version of their corresponding biome. Each type has its own set of unique drops, including powerful early Hardmode weapons and tools. Like ordinary Mimics, they only spawn in Hardmode worlds. The Jungle variant spawns only in Celebrationmk10 and Get fixed boi worlds. On the Old Chinese version and tModLoader 1.3-Legacy version, it is unimplemented and never spawns during normal gameplay. Similar to ordinary Mimics, these special variants disguise themselves as "Chests" until approached or attacked, but they do not resemble any Chest type currently in the game, and are significantly larger than ordinary Chests. Hallowed, Corrupt, and Crimson Mimics can also be summoned manually by the player, in Hardmode worlds only, by placing a Key of Light or a Key of Night inside an otherwise empty Chest; the Chest becomes a Mimic once it is closed. Note that this does not work using other storage items, such as Dressers. The natural evil biome of the current world determines whether a Corrupt or a Crimson Mimic is summoned via the Key of Night. All four special Mimics have the same attack patterns: The Jungle Mimic has an additional "attack" called the "stuff cannon", which consists of hurling 10 of the following blocks (in "dropped form") at the player: While disguised, Mimics will not show a usual enemy tooltip when hovering the mouse cursor over them. Below are some tips to help differentiate real chests from Mimics.

Description:
The Wall of Flesh is the final and strongest pre-Hardmode boss, spawnable only in The Underworld. Once it is defeated, the world permanently converts to Hardmode, which brings new content and challenges. This means that once the Wall is defeated, new biomes will spawn, new monsters will attack you, and the game can be beaten. To defeat the Wall of Flesh, the player must attack either its eyes or its mouth. They all share the same life counter, so attacking any of the two will deplete the total health of the boss. However, the eyes have less defense (thus take more damage) than the mouth. No other parts of the Wall can be damaged. See below for information on the two exclusive debuffs from the boss, Horrified and The Tongue. While the Wall of Flesh is alive, the music Boss 2https://terraria.fandom.com/wiki/File:Music-Boss_2.mp3 will play. When Otherworldly music is enabled, the track Wall of Flesh (Otherworldly)https://terraria.fandom.com/wiki/File:Music-Wall_of_Flesh_(Otherworldly).mp3 will play instead. The Wall of Flesh is summoned immediately 75 blocks away from all visible players when a Guide Voodoo Doll is destroyed by being dropped into lava in the Underworld while the Guide is alive, killing the Guide. Dropping the doll into lava outside of Underworld, regardless if the Guide is alive, will not spawn it, and the Voodoo Doll is destroyed with no effect. In the PC version, Console version, Mobile version, and tModLoader version, the Wall of Flesh can also be summoned by letting the Guide be killed in the Underworld while the Guide is in contact with lava. Using this method, the Guide can die by any means, either from a player, an enemy or the environment, as long as he is touching lava when he dies.[1]If a Mediumcore player dies in lava (in the Underworld, and Guide is alive) with a Guide Voodoo Doll in their inventory, the Wall of Flesh is summoned. The Wall of Flesh's sweep direction is determined by its spawn location. Spawning it on either side of the world will cause it to sweep in the opposite direction (regardless of the direction the Doll was thrown). Maximum fight space can be achieved by spawning it at the extreme right or left of the world, though these areas have fewer natural structures and may require additional lava survival gear or construction. Be aware of the fact that The Wall of Flesh might not fight but just leave the battle if you spawn it too close to the edge. The Wall of Flesh will spawn level with the tile of lava that destroys the Guide Voodoo Doll, then begins adjusting to the player's current tile height, though there is a limit to this. Digging a tunnel near the bottom of the world can leave the player unable to deal damage to the Wall of Flesh, and it's recommended such setups stay relatively near to the Underworld's surface elevation.

Description:
The Skeleton Sniper is a rare post-Plantera, Hardmode Dungeon enemy that attacks from long range. A Skeleton Sniper approaches a targeted player slowly and, as soon as it has a clear line-of-sight to the player, pauses briefly before firing a single shot. This shot can be fired from offscreen, and deals enough damage to kill a player with maximum health in three hits (two in Expert mode, one in Master mode). It is one of the few entities that can be detected by the Lifeform Analyzer or its upgrades. The Skeleton Sniper spawns most often in areas of the Dungeon backed by Slab Walls, along with Rusty Armored Bones and Ragged Casters. Removing these naturally occurring back walls will prevent these enemies from spawning, but they cannot be replaced to spawn these enemies elsewhere (unless you toss the walls into Shimmer to create Cursed Dungeon Slab Walls). These areas can further be identified by the presence of Ragged Brotherhood Sigils and Rusted Company Standards, but these banners are purely indicative and do not influence spawning.

The Eater of Worlds is a pre-Hardmode Corruption-themed worm boss. It is summoned using Worm Food from within the Corruption and Underground Corruption, or by destroying 3 Shadow Orbs that spawn in Corruption-filled worlds. It can be summoned at any time of day. Do note that Eater of Worlds shoots vile spit in Expert and Master mode. The Eater of Worlds is not a single target, but a string of segments with individual life counters. When any inner body segment is destroyed, it splits into multiple smaller worms, each with their own head and tail. Each section of the Eater must be killed in order to defeat the entire boss. The Eater of Worlds, like all worms, is immune to lava. On the PC, Console, Mobile, and tModLoader versions, it has a total of 67 / 72 segments[1], and is only immune to the Confused debuff. On the Old-gen console, Windows Phone, Old Chinese, 3DS, and tModLoader Legacy versions, it has a total of 50 segments, and is immune to the Poisoned, Confused, Cursed Inferno, Shadowflame, On Fire!, and Venom debuffs. Fighting the Eater of Worlds is the only way to obtain Shadow Scales, and it's one of the only ways to obtain usable quantities of Demonite Ore, both necessary for crafting a Nightmare Pickaxe. Individual segments drop some of these when killed, with a larger bonus drop upon defeating the entire entity[2]. Defeating the Eater of Worlds allows the Tavernkeep NPC to spawn, and meteorites to land. The Eater of Worlds is the Corruption counterpart to the Crimson's Brain of Cthulhu. The Hardmode mechanical boss equivalent to the Eater of Worlds is the Destroyer. While the Eater of Worlds is alive, the music Boss 1https://terraria.fandom.com/wiki/File:Music-Boss_1.mp3 will play. When Otherworldly music is enabled, the track Boss 1 (Otherworldly)https://terraria.fandom.com/wiki/File:Music-Boss_1_(Otherworldly).mp3 will play instead.

Description:
The Wizard is a Hardmode NPC vendor who sells magic-related items. As soon as the Wall of Flesh has been defeated, he rarely spawns in the cavern layer or below. Similar to the Goblin Tinkerer, Mechanic, Golfer, Tavernkeep, and Stylist, he first spawns as the stationary Bound Wizard. Interacting with him will free him, after which he will respawn as long as a vacant house is available, even if killed. When enemies are in his vicinity, the Wizard hurls fireballs at them in a similar fashion to the Flower of Fire while casting an aesthetic magic circle, dealing 18 / 27 / 31 damage. He will occasionally replace his regular quote with a comment about the player's luck. This is the only way to estimate a player's luck value in the game. The Bound Wizard is one of the few entities that can be detected by the Lifeform Analyzer or its upgrades. For more information, see NPC happiness. When submerged in Shimmer, the Wizard will transform into his Shimmered form. This has no impact on gameplay or dialogue and is only a visual change. He can be returned to his classic look by submerging him in Shimmer again. The Wizard may have any of the following names:

The Etherian Goblin is an enemy from the Old One's Army event, being the most common throughout most of the waves. It attacks by slowly approaching its target, hacking away with its weapon upon contact.

If an Etherian Goblin's target is too far away or obstructed, it will enter an ethereal state, allowing it to pass through tiles. It is also unaffected by Teleporters or Lava. The Etherian Goblin requires 1000 kills to be awarded with its corresponding banner, as opposed to the usual 50 kills.

Description:
The Cultists are Hardmode, post-Golem enemies that spawn along with a Mysterious Tablet at the entrance to the Dungeon after the Golem has been defeated. Four Cultists will appear there: two Cultist Archers and two Lunatic Devotees. Defeating all four of the Cultists causes the Lunatic Cultist boss to spawn instantly at their location, destroying the Mysterious Tablet in the process. Defeating the Lunatic Cultist then initiates the Lunar Events. Until one of the Cultists is attacked, they are passive and deal no contact damage, and players can walk through them freely without activating them. Attacking any of the four will awaken the Archers, who will begin to fire Wooden Arrows using bows and will deal contact damage. Lunatic Devotees are always passive and never deal contact damage. All four Cultists respawn and reset their location and initial passive state after one in-game day, if the Lunatic Cultist was not summoned, if the player runs away or dies during the fight, when all four Celestial Pillars are destroyed, or when the world is closed and restarted. Restarting the world can be the fastest option to reset them to their original state.

Description:
Deerclops is a pre-Hardmode boss, encountered in the Snow biome at midnight during a Blizzard if at least one player in the world has either at least 9 defense or 200 health, or by summoning it using a Deer Thing in the Snow biome. It will not spawn naturally if there are NPCs too close to the player. Fighting the Deerclops is not required for game progression, but defeating it rewards the player with coins and other useful items.

Description:
The Nymph is a rare enemy that spawns in the Cavern layer of any biome. When encountered, she appears as the Lost Girl, who seems to be a helpless NPC in need of rescue. When a player gets close or attacks the Lost Girl, she transforms into the Nymph and starts attacking the player. For a pre-Hardmode enemy, she deals comparatively high damage. The Lost Girl will transform into a Nymph if any of the following conditions are met:[1] The Lost Girl is immune to the Confused debuff, but the transformed Nymph is not. She is one of the few entities that can be detected by the Lifeform Analyzer or its upgrades.

Description:
The Angler is an NPC concerned exclusively with catching fish, who appears as a young child. He does not sell anything, but rather assigns quests to players. Quest objectives generally involve catching him rare fish from particular biomes or layers, for which he dispenses various rewards. On PC, Console, Mobile, Old Chinese, tModLoader, and tModLoader Legacy, he will throw Frost Daggerfish at nearby enemies when threatened, dealing 10 / 15 / 17 damage at the start of the game. The Angler is first encountered as the Sleeping Angler randomly spawning on the sand or on the water surface of the Ocean biome (or rarely in the underworld). He will move in when: The Sleeping Angler is one of the few entities that can be detected by the Lifeform Analyzer or its upgrades. After a quest has been completed, the Angler will reward the player with one item, a number of Coins, and possibly some bait. Notes: Only one of the following special rewards may be obtained. The chances listed are affected by the number of quests completed. Chances are rolled in the order given by the list below, starting from the top. This means rewards near the bottom have a slightly lowered chance of being obtained than what is listed. These chances are not affected by Luck. If none of the rewards listed above are rewarded, one of the following will be obtained, and in no particular order. Chances are unaffected by Luck, the number of quests completed, nor by the Angler's happiness. If bait is being rewarded, chances of getting which type are in the order listed below. The chances listed are affected by the number of quests completed. As noted above, chance of obtaining bait ranges from 50% to 100% and is based on the number of quests completed. The minimum amount of bait obtained is determined by the number of quests completed. Once 25, 50, 100, 150, 200 and 250 quests are completed, the minimum amount is increased by 1, for a total of 7 bait. There is also a small chance of obtaining an extra bait if below 250 quests completed. For more information, see NPC happiness. When submerged in Shimmer, the Angler will transform into his Shimmered form. This has no impact on gameplay or dialogue and is only a visual change. He can be returned to his classic look by submerging him in Shimmer again.

The Moss Hornet is a Hardmode flying enemy similar to the pre-Hardmode Hornet, being encountered in the Underground Jungle as well. Compared to the more random flying patterns of pre-Hardmode Hornets, Moss Hornets act more aggressively, hovering closer to the player's position and shooting their stingers in rapid bursts. The stingers have a 33.33*1/3 (33.33%) chance to inflict the Poisoned debuff to the player for 10 seconds. In Expert Mode, the chance is 33.33*1/3 (33.33%) for 20 seconds and 66.67*2/3 (66.67%) for 2–10 seconds. They cannot be destroyed with weapons and travel at about the same speed as the darts from a Dart Trap. Moss Hornets have a 0.67*1/150 (0.67%) chance to drop Tattered Bee Wing if any Mechanical boss has been defeated in the world, which is solely used in the creation of Bee Wings.

Description:
The Wall of Flesh is the final and strongest pre-Hardmode boss, spawnable only in The Underworld. Once it is defeated, the world permanently converts to Hardmode, which brings new content and challenges. This means that once the Wall is defeated, new biomes will spawn, new monsters will attack you, and the game can be beaten. To defeat the Wall of Flesh, the player must attack either its eyes or its mouth. They all share the same life counter, so attacking any of the two will deplete the total health of the boss. However, the eyes have less defense (thus take more damage) than the mouth. No other parts of the Wall can be damaged. See below for information on the two exclusive debuffs from the boss, Horrified and The Tongue. While the Wall of Flesh is alive, the music Boss 2https://terraria.fandom.com/wiki/File:Music-Boss_2.mp3 will play. When Otherworldly music is enabled, the track Wall of Flesh (Otherworldly)https://terraria.fandom.com/wiki/File:Music-Wall_of_Flesh_(Otherworldly).mp3 will play instead. The Wall of Flesh is summoned immediately 75 blocks away from all visible players when a Guide Voodoo Doll is destroyed by being dropped into lava in the Underworld while the Guide is alive, killing the Guide. Dropping the doll into lava outside of Underworld, regardless if the Guide is alive, will not spawn it, and the Voodoo Doll is destroyed with no effect. In the PC version, Console version, Mobile version, and tModLoader version, the Wall of Flesh can also be summoned by letting the Guide be killed in the Underworld while the Guide is in contact with lava. Using this method, the Guide can die by any means, either from a player, an enemy or the environment, as long as he is touching lava when he dies.[1]If a Mediumcore player dies in lava (in the Underworld, and Guide is alive) with a Guide Voodoo Doll in their inventory, the Wall of Flesh is summoned. The Wall of Flesh's sweep direction is determined by its spawn location. Spawning it on either side of the world will cause it to sweep in the opposite direction (regardless of the direction the Doll was thrown). Maximum fight space can be achieved by spawning it at the extreme right or left of the world, though these areas have fewer natural structures and may require additional lava survival gear or construction. Be aware of the fact that The Wall of Flesh might not fight but just leave the battle if you spawn it too close to the edge. The Wall of Flesh will spawn level with the tile of lava that destroys the Guide Voodoo Doll, then begins adjusting to the player's current tile height, though there is a limit to this. Digging a tunnel near the bottom of the world can leave the player unable to deal damage to the Wall of Flesh, and it's recommended such setups stay relatively near to the Underworld's surface elevation.

It is widely considered the most difficult of these five enemies. If the Dreadnautilus is not defeated by dawn (4:30 AM), it will fly away and despawn.

Description:
The Nurse is an NPC that will spawn once the following criteria have been met: The Nurse will heal the player's health and cure them of any active debuffs at the cost of Coins (there are exceptions, see Notes and History). In the Windows Phone, Old Chinese, 3DS, and tModLoader Legacy versions, healing costs can range from a few Copper to several Silver Coins, depending on how much health the player is missing. She charges Copper equal to 75% of the health restored (e.g. 75 for restoring 100 health), plus an additional 750 for every active debuff on the player. In the PC version, Console version, Mobile version, and tModLoader version, healing costs are 1 per health restored, plus an additional 1 per active debuff on the player, all multiplied by the Nurse's current Happiness price adjustment, and then doubled if playing on Expert Mode. Also, the Nurse charges increasing amounts of money for healing as the game progresses; these specific increases are detailed below. Thus, at the start of the game, the cost of restoring 100 health can range from 75 / 150 (with maximum happiness) to 150 / 3 (with maximum unhappiness), while by endgame it can range from 150 / 3 up to 3 / 6. In the PC version, Console version, Mobile version, Old Chinese version, tModLoader version, and tModLoader 1.3-Legacy version, she will fight enemies by throwing syringes that will deal 8 / 12 / 14 damage (affected by various stat boosts), and poison enemies for 3–5 seconds.[1] She can also use healing syringes to heal herself and other nearby NPCs for 20 health.[2] The cost of healing changes based on three factors: The Nurse's current Happiness, game progression, and Expert Mode. Happiness affects the Nurse's price by raising or lowering it to within a range of 75% to 150% of its base (in the same way that other NPCs' prices are affected by their happiness). Playing in Expert (or Master) mode further affects prices by permanently doubling them. Progression-based price increases are based on which bosses have been defeated in the current world. These increases are listed in the table below; only the single highest applicable increase is chosen and applied. For more information, see NPC happiness. When submerged in Shimmer, the Nurse will transform into her Shimmered form. This has no impact on gameplay or dialogue and is only a visual change. She can be returned to her classic look by submerging her in Shimmer again. The Nurse may have any of the following names:

Description:
The Cultists are Hardmode, post-Golem enemies that spawn along with a Mysterious Tablet at the entrance to the Dungeon after the Golem has been defeated. Four Cultists will appear there: two Cultist Archers and two Lunatic Devotees. Defeating all four of the Cultists causes the Lunatic Cultist boss to spawn instantly at their location, destroying the Mysterious Tablet in the process. Defeating the Lunatic Cultist then initiates the Lunar Events. Until one of the Cultists is attacked, they are passive and deal no contact damage, and players can walk through them freely without activating them. Attacking any of the four will awaken the Archers, who will begin to fire Wooden Arrows using bows and will deal contact damage. Lunatic Devotees are always passive and never deal contact damage. All four Cultists respawn and reset their location and initial passive state after one in-game day, if the Lunatic Cultist was not summoned, if the player runs away or dies during the fight, when all four Celestial Pillars are destroyed, or when the world is closed and restarted. Restarting the world can be the fastest option to reset them to their original state.

Description:
Skeletron is a pre-Hardmode boss. It must be defeated prior to entering the Dungeon, and defeating it grants unlimited access to all Dungeon areas for all players. It also causes the Clothier NPC to spawn, as long as a vacant house is available. If attempting to enter the Dungeon before killing Skeletron, Dungeon Guardians spawn once a player reaches 0 depth.[1] These enemies generally kill any player with a single hit, dealing 1000 / 2000 / 3000 damage. Managing to defeat a Dungeon Guardian does not grant access to the Dungeon, thus defeating Skeletron is mandatory for (safely) entering the Dungeon. While Skeletron is alive, the music Boss 1https://terraria.fandom.com/wiki/File:Music-Boss_1.mp3 will play. When Otherworldly music is enabled, the track Boss 1 (Otherworldly)https://terraria.fandom.com/wiki/File:Music-Boss_1_(Otherworldly).mp3 will play instead. Skeletron is summoned by speaking to the Old Man at the Dungeon's entrance at night, who will turn into Skeletron when selecting the "Curse" option. If the Old Man is spoken to during the day, he will ask the player to return at night. Skeletron can only be summoned once per night, as the Old Man will not respawn until dawn. While players with less than 300 maximum health and/or less than 10 defense are deemed too weak by the Old Man to lift his curse, he still offers the option to summon Skeletron. Skeletron can be summoned repeatedly this way until it is defeated. Once it is defeated, the Old Man's curse will be lifted and he will no longer appear. Skeletron can be re-summoned thereafter once the player acquires the Clothier Voodoo Doll (from Angry Bones or Dark Casters), then by attacking and killing the Clothier during night. Killing the Clothier using Flymeal will not summon Skeletron unless the Clothier Voodoo Doll is equipped.

It can only launch its projectile at an upwards angle (within about 45 degrees to the left and right), so players approaching from lower ground are usually out of its line of fire. The sand projectiles turn into clumps of Sand Blocks when hitting an object, and will gather on the ground, similarly to the projectiles fired by the Sandgun. On the Old-gen console version, Windows Phone version, and Nintendo 3DS version, the Albino Antlion variant also appears.

The Princess will attack nearby enemies with the Resonance Scepter to defend herself (although the animation of the Scepter is not shown). The Princess is unique in that she does not have any biome or neighbor preferences. She loves up to three NPCs that live nearby and is liked by all NPCs around her. She also hates being lonely and her unhappiness is maxed to 150% if she is not surrounded by at least 2 other NPCs within 25 tiles, or 2 other NPCs that are between 25 and 120 tiles away.[2] When submerged in Shimmer, the Princess will transform into her Shimmered form.

Reapers behave in a similar manner to Wraiths, but they have higher stats. They move significantly faster than Wraiths, and with the higher spawn rate of the Solar Eclipse, they often attack from multiple directions at once. They are fairly vulnerable to knockback. Like many creatures that pass through blocks, they do not take damage from lava. Furthermore, weapons whose animations do not stop upon hitting blocks, like most melee weapons, will damage them despite not normally being able to attack through blocks.

Description:
The Clothier is an NPC vendor who sells mainly vanity items. He is the same character as the Old Man who guards the Dungeon before Skeletron is defeated. After defeating Skeletron, the Old Man is freed from his curse, and he disappears from the Dungeon's entrance. Once a suitable vacant house is available thereafter, he spawns and sells items. His clothes are no longer tattered, his eyes have turned blue (from red), and he is wearing a Red Hat. Equipping the Clothier Voodoo Doll allows a player to attack and kill the Clothier (similar to the Guide Voodoo Doll). Doing so at night re-summons Skeletron. Killing him with the Flymeal will not summon Skeletron however. When threatened on the PC version, Console version, Mobile version, Old Chinese version, tModLoader version, and tModLoader 1.3-Legacy version, the Clothier fires shadowflame skull projectiles similar to those produced by the Book of Skulls. They inflict enemies with the Shadowflame debuff for 5–10 seconds[2] and deal 16 / 24 / 28 damage at the start of the game, but as the player progresses, the Clothier will gain various stat increases.[1] For more information, see NPC happiness. When submerged in Shimmer, the Clothier will transform into his Shimmered form. This has no impact on gameplay or dialogue and is only a visual change. He can be returned to his classic look by submerging him in Shimmer again. The Clothier may have any of the following names:

Hairstyle cost: The Stylist's prices can vary depending on her Happiness; this also affects her prices for hairstyle and/or color changes, as follows: When confronted by enemies, the Stylist will use Stylish Scissors to defend herself, dealing 10 / 15 / 17 damage at the start of the game, and as players progress she will gain various stat increases.[1] Note that the scissors' knockback is enough to completely protect her from almost every ghost-like enemy.

Description:
Jellyfish are enemies found in water. When underwater, they attack by propelling themselves towards the player in short bursts. When outside of water, they will be unable to move or pursue the player in any way. Jellyfish are able to jump out of the water to attack players, often leaving them stranded on land. Most varieties of Jellyfish produce light, making them easy to spot in dark areas. There are currently 5 Jellyfish variants, 3 of which only appear during Hardmode. Blue Jellyfish only spawn in pre-Hardmode and are replaced by the Green variant in Hardmode. In Expert Mode, Jellyfish will periodically become electrified, making them invincible for the duration of the attack. If the player attacks a Jellyfish with a sword while it is electrified (or any other swung item that deals direct damage, such as most tools), the player will be hurt. A Jellyfish will constantly maintain its speed while electrified unless it comes into contact with a wall or the water's surface.

Description:
The Spore Zombie is a zombie variant that only appears in Glowing Mushroom biomes at any point in the game. It acts the same as normal zombies, slowly walking towards the player to deal contact damage, while attempting to navigate around obstacles. However, it is differentiable by normal zombies due to its mushroom-covered appearance, spawning at any time of day, and generally more powerful stats. Unlike normal zombies, it is always able to open doors regardless of whether or not it is a Blood Moon. Spore Zombies can appear in two different variations with slightly different stats. Unlike normal zombies, it does not have an armed variation in Expert Mode.

Name: Celestial Pillars
Type: Enemy

Stats:
• Environment: Lunar Events
• Damage: 0
• Max Life: 20000
• Defense: 20
• Knockback Resist: 100%

Description:
The Celestial Pillars (also known as the Lunar Pillars, Lunar Towers, or Celestial Towers) are four bosses that appear during the Lunar Events, when the Lunatic Cultist has been defeated. They appear at four locations equally spaced across the map (see pillar spawning mechanics below), and are completely stationary, apart from slowly bobbing up and down in place. Each pillar takes control of the map in a circular area around it with a radius of 250 tiles, or 500 feet.[1] When the player is in that affected area, the background will change to a pillar-specific one, and only pillar-specific enemies will spawn, in large numbers. The four Celestial Pillars are the Solar Pillar, the Vortex Pillar, the Nebula Pillar and the Stardust Pillar. Judging by the gear craftable from the fragments that they drop when defeated, they represent the four damage types in Terraria: Solar for melee, Vortex for ranged, Nebula for magic, and Stardust for summon. Initially, the Celestial Pillars have a large force field around them, which prevents them from taking any damage. In order to remove the force field, the player needs to defeat 100 (50 if Moon Lord has been defeated) enemies that correspond to that particular pillar. After doing that, the force field will lower and the pillar can be damaged. Enemies will continue to spawn until the pillar is defeated. If the player exits the world without destroying a pillar, all damage done to it will be reset, and the kill count needed to remove the shield will also reset. However, player deaths will not reset them. When destroyed, the Celestial Pillars each drop between 12–60 / 24–100 Lunar Fragments of their type. The Pillars themselves are fairly easy to defeat, having only 20000 HP each and having weak attacks (none in the case of the Nebula Pillar). The direct threat comes from the minions they spawn; they can deal high amounts of damage, can inflict debuffs, and easily swarm the player if not dealt with quickly. There is no set order in which the Celestial Pillars must be defeated. The following status messages will appear from whichever pillars are taken down first, second, third, and fourth: After defeating all four Celestial Pillars, the screen will start to vibrate, and the music volume will lower before eventually going completely silent. One minute after the pillars' defeat, the Moon Lord will spawn. The Solar Pillar is the melee-themed pillar, with minions that bear strong defensive abilities and deal heavy contact damage. When nearby, the world is tinted orange, and the background will display a massive orange planet with a shower of falling meteors. It drops Solar Fragments when defeated. The Solar Pillar will continuously spew fireballs that deal high contact damage. It is widely considered to be the most difficult of the four, due to the Crawltipede forcing the player to stay grounded, leaving them vulnerable to the variety of other ground enemies that the pillar spawns. The Vortex Pillar is the ranged-themed pillar, with fast, mobile minions capable of long-ranged projectile attacks. When nearby, the world is tinted teal, and the background will display a teal planet with lightning. It drops Vortex Fragments when defeated. It will occasionally open a portal above the player that spawns two Alien Hornets or a lightning bolt, identical to the one produced by the Vortexian on death. This pillar's color scheme seems to resemble that of the Moon Lord. The Nebula Pillar is the magic-themed pillar, with minions capable of flight, teleportation, and other unusual attacks and abilities. When nearby, the world is tinted pink, and the background will display a pinkish-purple planet with beams of energy pulling debris into the sky. It drops Nebula Fragments when defeated. The Nebula Pillar is the only pillar that does not have any attack of its own. In addition, its enemies have a pulsing aura effect to make them easier to see. The Stardust Pillar is the summoning-themed pillar, with large swarms of enemies that spawn smaller, weaker entities to attack. When nearby, the world is tinted blue, and the background will display a blue planet and a sparkling effect. It drops Stardust Fragments when defeated. The Stardust Pillar is able to spawn extra enemies above itself on screen from constellations. Periodically, a random pattern of linked orb-like "stars" will flash, starting and branching out from the pillar's top to form a crude "constellation". The constellation flashes one star at a time, before spawning in a random enemy from the final star. When it is time for the four pillars to spawn, the game follows the following steps.[4] All coordinates are in tiles. Using the above spawning mechanics, the approximate location of each pillar can easily be computed relative to the world's default spawn point (i.e. the center of the map). Assuming S is the world size (in feet) and PX is the location factor (0.2, 0.4, 0.6, or 0.8) for pillar X, then the relative location RX can be computed as RX = (S × PX) - S ÷ 2. The exact location of each pillar will vary randomly up to 100 tiles (200 feet) left or right. This is visualized in the following table, which represents the profile of a world. Remember that the order of pillars is random, the one used here is only an example.

Description:
The Nebula Floater is a Hardmode, post-Lunatic Cultist flying enemy that spawns near the Nebula Pillar during the Lunar Events. It periodically spawns miniature eyes that float around it. Its main attack is either ramming into the player, or by distancing itself and proceeding to shoot a pink Nebula Laser from one of its followers at you, dealing significant amounts of damage. It will also try to teleport around the player while firing its laser, appearing to do this more often in Expert Mode. It is one of the enemies of the Nebula Pillar event that must be paid attention to. They are somewhat common and in groups can overwhelm the player.

He attacks by hopping towards the player in a manner identical to most Slimes. The difference, however, is that the lower on health he is, the quicker he becomes. Notably, as Hoppin' Jack is actually a pumpkin that uses the Slime AI, he is not treated as a slime for most other purposes. Hoppin' Jack drops no Gel on death, will remain hostile to a player with Royal Gel equipped, and killing one is not necessary to earn the Gelatin World Tour () or Slimer/King of Slimes () achievements.

Description:
Zombies are common surface enemies that appear at night, and are a primary reason newer players will want to build a shelter before night arrives. Along with Demon Eyes, they are generally among the first night enemies a player will encounter, as they appear in areas a player first spawns. Multiple NPCs living in the area will reduce or prevent local enemy spawns, including Zombies. Zombies follow the Fighter AI and walk towards the player, dealing damage on contact. They can jump and navigate platforms. Zombies will seem to hit closed doors in their path repeatedly, though most of them cannot open Doors unless it is a Blood Moon (during which Blood Zombies will spawn and be able to open doors); Spore Zombies can open doors at any time. In Expert Mode, some Zombies carry disembodied arms. These deal more damage on contact than other zombies and will stop to perform a "slashing" animation when near the player, extending the range at which they can damage the player. These arm-wielding zombies are unable to open or interact with doors at any time.

As Green Slimes spawn commonly in the Forest during the daytime, they are likely the first enemy a player will come across in a new world. Green Slimes will not target the player under usual circumstances, but will become aggressive when damaged, during the night, or if brought underground. Like most other slimes, the Green Slime will be passive towards any player with the Royal Gel accessory equipped. On PC, Console, Mobile, Old Chinese, 3DS, tModLoader, and tModLoader Legacy, they can rarely be found carrying bonus drops, which the player receives upon the slime's death.

Description:
Golem is a Hardmode, post-Plantera boss found in the Jungle Temple and is by far one of the easiest bosses in the game relative to game progression. While Golem is alive, the music Golemhttps://terraria.fandom.com/wiki/File:Music-Golem.mp3 will play. When Otherworldly music is enabled, the track Boss 2 (Otherworldly)https://terraria.fandom.com/wiki/File:Music-Boss_2_(Otherworldly).mp3 will play instead. Golem is summoned by using the Lihzahrd Power Cell ⚷ Interact on the Lihzahrd Altar, located in the final Jungle Temple chamber, while at least one Lihzahrd Power Cell is in the player's inventory. A Lihzahrd Power Cell is contained within each of the Jungle Temple's Lihzahrd Chests, and can be dropped rarely by Lihzahrds or Flying Snakes (2*1/50 (2%) chance). Golem spawns directly above the Altar. Plantera must have already been defeated at least once in the current world in order for Golem to spawn successfully. Otherwise, nothing will happen and the power cell will not be consumed. Because of this, to fight Golem in a brand new world, the player is required to kill Plantera, the three mechanical bosses, and the Wall of Flesh at least once.

It also allows the player to craft the Sandstorm in a Bottle, which may be useful in worlds without a Pyramid. Sand Elementals attack by summoning three Ancient Storms randomly around the general location of the player. The distance between them varies, and they remain stationary for their lifespan. Sand Elementals cannot travel through blocks, and fly in a non-linear pattern. They attempt to move towards the player and get faster as their health depletes. She is one of the few entities that can be detected by the Lifeform Analyzer or its upgrades.

Type: NPC

Stats:
• Damage: 10

• Defense: 15
• Knockback Resist: 50%

Description:
The Bunny is a town pet. It arrives at dawn (4:30 AM) the day after the player uses the Bunny License, which is purchased from the Zoologist for 5. The Bunny does not count towards the NPCs' "crowded" limit and hence will not affect NPC happiness, although it does count as a regular town NPC for the purpose of the Pylon network. There are six breeds of Bunny, with one randomly being chosen when it arrives. The only requirements for the Bunny to appear is the use of a Bunny License and the presence of a valid house. The Bunny's house can be changed, as with any other NPC, however the Bunny can share the same house as another NPC. The Bunny needs a 2-tile floor space to sleep on occasionally; it may not move into a house if that space is not available. The Bunny can be talked to with the ⚷ Interact button, like any other town NPC. It will offer a "Pet" option, which places the player directly in front of the Bunny when selected, and displays an animation of them petting the Bunny, an effect that is a purely visual. It only works if there are at least two flat tiles on the same level as the Bunny in front of it. Using any item, taking damage, or closing the dialogue window terminates the animation. Like the Angler and the Princess, the status message displayed when the Bunny is killed is "<name of Bunny> has left!". It will respawn within the next days, and may respawn as a different breed. The Town Bunny may have any of the following names:

This debuff turns the player to stone: The debuff's onset is marked by Medusa's snake hair (as well as Medusa herself) lashing out red tongues, as well as a unique noise and particle effect, giving players notice before they are petrified. Players can avoid getting stoned by facing the other direction when the animation completes, or by having the Medusa's line of sight blocked by solid blocks. The less health Medusa has, the faster she will move, similar to the Wall of Flesh.

The Dye Trader is an NPC that sells the Dye Vat and other dye-related items. He will move in when the following criteria have been met: In addition to selling dye-related items, players may trade in Strange Plants for uncraftable and unpurchasable animated dyes once Hardmode has been reached. These dyes are given at random in sets of six / three for each exchanged Strange Plant. The Dye Trader will attack nearby enemies with his Exotic Scimitar to defend himself, and may drop his weapon on death. He will deal 11 / 16 / 19 damage at the start of the game, and as players progress he will gain various stat increases. Speaking to the Dye Trader will show the "Strange Plants" quest ( in Hardmode), in which the Dye Trader asks players to fetch him rare plants. In return, he rewards players with six / three vials of a special dye which cannot be obtained otherwise. More of these dyes become available as the game progresses. For more information, see NPC happiness. When submerged in Shimmer, the Dye Trader will transform into his Shimmered form. This has no impact on gameplay or dialogue and is only a visual change.

Giant Shellies attack very quickly and deal high damage for the stage in the game where they are found. Giant Shellies are unique in that their ability to spawn is connected to two other enemies: the Crawdad and the Salamander. Of these three enemies, a world will choose two types that it can spawn, leaving the third inaccessible. Giant Shellies will never spawn in a world that features both Crawdads and Salamanders together. In the PC version, Console version, Mobile version, and tModLoader version, this is taken into account by the Bestiary progression logic, and the missing enemy will register as unlocked when the other two exclusive creatures are unlocked.

Name: Celestial Pillars
Type: Enemy

Stats:
• Environment: Lunar Events
• Damage: 0
• Max Life: 20000
• Defense: 20
• Knockback Resist: 100%

Description:
The Celestial Pillars (also known as the Lunar Pillars, Lunar Towers, or Celestial Towers) are four bosses that appear during the Lunar Events, when the Lunatic Cultist has been defeated. They appear at four locations equally spaced across the map (see pillar spawning mechanics below), and are completely stationary, apart from slowly bobbing up and down in place. Each pillar takes control of the map in a circular area around it with a radius of 250 tiles, or 500 feet.[1] When the player is in that affected area, the background will change to a pillar-specific one, and only pillar-specific enemies will spawn, in large numbers. The four Celestial Pillars are the Solar Pillar, the Vortex Pillar, the Nebula Pillar and the Stardust Pillar. Judging by the gear craftable from the fragments that they drop when defeated, they represent the four damage types in Terraria: Solar for melee, Vortex for ranged, Nebula for magic, and Stardust for summon. Initially, the Celestial Pillars have a large force field around them, which prevents them from taking any damage. In order to remove the force field, the player needs to defeat 100 (50 if Moon Lord has been defeated) enemies that correspond to that particular pillar. After doing that, the force field will lower and the pillar can be damaged. Enemies will continue to spawn until the pillar is defeated. If the player exits the world without destroying a pillar, all damage done to it will be reset, and the kill count needed to remove the shield will also reset. However, player deaths will not reset them. When destroyed, the Celestial Pillars each drop between 12–60 / 24–100 Lunar Fragments of their type. The Pillars themselves are fairly easy to defeat, having only 20000 HP each and having weak attacks (none in the case of the Nebula Pillar). The direct threat comes from the minions they spawn; they can deal high amounts of damage, can inflict debuffs, and easily swarm the player if not dealt with quickly. There is no set order in which the Celestial Pillars must be defeated. The following status messages will appear from whichever pillars are taken down first, second, third, and fourth: After defeating all four Celestial Pillars, the screen will start to vibrate, and the music volume will lower before eventually going completely silent. One minute after the pillars' defeat, the Moon Lord will spawn. The Solar Pillar is the melee-themed pillar, with minions that bear strong defensive abilities and deal heavy contact damage. When nearby, the world is tinted orange, and the background will display a massive orange planet with a shower of falling meteors. It drops Solar Fragments when defeated. The Solar Pillar will continuously spew fireballs that deal high contact damage. It is widely considered to be the most difficult of the four, due to the Crawltipede forcing the player to stay grounded, leaving them vulnerable to the variety of other ground enemies that the pillar spawns. The Vortex Pillar is the ranged-themed pillar, with fast, mobile minions capable of long-ranged projectile attacks. When nearby, the world is tinted teal, and the background will display a teal planet with lightning. It drops Vortex Fragments when defeated. It will occasionally open a portal above the player that spawns two Alien Hornets or a lightning bolt, identical to the one produced by the Vortexian on death. This pillar's color scheme seems to resemble that of the Moon Lord. The Nebula Pillar is the magic-themed pillar, with minions capable of flight, teleportation, and other unusual attacks and abilities. When nearby, the world is tinted pink, and the background will display a pinkish-purple planet with beams of energy pulling debris into the sky. It drops Nebula Fragments when defeated. The Nebula Pillar is the only pillar that does not have any attack of its own. In addition, its enemies have a pulsing aura effect to make them easier to see. The Stardust Pillar is the summoning-themed pillar, with large swarms of enemies that spawn smaller, weaker entities to attack. When nearby, the world is tinted blue, and the background will display a blue planet and a sparkling effect. It drops Stardust Fragments when defeated. The Stardust Pillar is able to spawn extra enemies above itself on screen from constellations. Periodically, a random pattern of linked orb-like "stars" will flash, starting and branching out from the pillar's top to form a crude "constellation". The constellation flashes one star at a time, before spawning in a random enemy from the final star. When it is time for the four pillars to spawn, the game follows the following steps.[4] All coordinates are in tiles. Using the above spawning mechanics, the approximate location of each pillar can easily be computed relative to the world's default spawn point (i.e. the center of the map). Assuming S is the world size (in feet) and PX is the location factor (0.2, 0.4, 0.6, or 0.8) for pillar X, then the relative location RX can be computed as RX = (S × PX) - S ÷ 2. The exact location of each pillar will vary randomly up to 100 tiles (200 feet) left or right. This is visualized in the following table, which represents the profile of a world. Remember that the order of pillars is random, the one used here is only an example.

If a world is in Expert Mode, they can inflict the Feral Bite Debuff as well as dealing more damage, making them much more dangerous than those on a classic world. Like most other bats, they cannot enter water.

Name: Empress of Light
Type: Boss

Stats:
• Environment: The Hallow
• Damage: 80110165 (melee)120165248 (dash)90120180 (Prismatic Bolt)100140210 (Sun Dance)90120180 (Everlasting Rainbow)100120180 (Ethereal Lance)
• Max Life: 70000/98000/124950
• Defense: 50
• Knockback Resist: 100%

Behavior:
If fought during the day, the Empress enters an "enraged" state, indicated by the color of attacks turning a bright yellow. While enraged, all of her attacks instantly kill the player regardless of equipment. See below for exceptions.
If summoned during the day and not defeated in time, she will vanish at 7:30PM and drop nothing.
If fought in Expert or Master Mode, she will always use her enraged attack pattern, but without the massive damage increase.

Attacks:
• Prismatic Bolts - Summons a cloud of prismatic bolts that home in on the player after a short delay. These bolts do not have perfect tracking, and will miss if the player makes a sharp turn as they approach.
• Prismatic Bolts 2 - Fires prismatic bolts in a clockwise spiral, which behave identically to those used in the first variant of the attack. This version is harder to dodge, and when she is enraged she summons more bolts.
• Dash Attack - Positions herself to the left or right of the player before charging horizontally in the player’s direction. This attack is additionally preceded by a sound effect and several images of the Empress spinning around her right before she dashes. She briefly becomes invincible during the attack, removing any Daybreak spears attached to her and marks from whips.
• Sun Dance - Hovers above and slightly to the left of the player and emits 6 persistent rays of light (8 if enraged) that slowly rotate clockwise around her. 3 sets of rays are created per sun dance, each positioned slightly further clockwise than the last.
• Everlasting Rainbow - Releases a ring of 13 stars that slowly spiral out clockwise from her original position, then spiral back inward in the same direction. These stars leave behind a trail of light that will damage the player.
• Ethereal Lance - Summons a swarm of swords that launch in the direction the player was headed when they were summoned, telegraphed by colored beams. These swords are summoned behind where the player was moving, or all around the player if they were stationary. The swords do no damage until launched. If enraged, extra swords are summoned, and they will launch faster.
• Ethereal Lance 2 - Summons four evenly spaced waves of swords that travel across the screen, telegraphed by colored beams. The first wave travels from the left side of the screen to the right, the second from right to left, the third wave from top-left to bottom-right, and the fourth wave from top-right to bottom-left. If enraged, there will instead be six waves of swords that target specific points around the player instead of traveling from one side of the screen to the other. The first wave travels from the left side of the screen to the right of the player, the second wave from the right side to the left of the player, the third wave from top side to the bottom-right of the player, the fourth wave from top side to bottom-left of the player, the fifth wave from the bottom side to top-right of the player, and the sixth wave from the bottom side to top left of the player.

Description:
The Empress of Light is a Hardmode, post-Plantera boss fought in The Hallow. While she can be fought as soon as Plantera is defeated, she is significantly more difficult than most Hardmode bosses and will typically require post-Golem gear. The Empress of Light fight is optional and is not required for progression. While the Empress of Light is alive, her exclusive music Empress of Lighthttps://terraria.fandom.com/wiki/File:Music-Empress_of_Light.mp3 will play. When Otherworldly music is enabled, the track Boss 2 (Otherworldly)https://terraria.fandom.com/wiki/File:Music-Boss_2_(Otherworldly).mp3 will play instead. The Empress of Light is summoned by killing a Prismatic Lacewing, a rare critter that spawns in the surface Hallow at night between 7:30 PM - 12:00 AM once Plantera has been defeated in the current world. The Prismatic Lacewing is one of the few entities that can be detected by the Lifeform Analyzer. The Prismatic Lacewing can be killed at any time in any biome to summon the boss. However, if released outside of the Hallow biome it will despawn near instantly, so it must be placed onto a persisting and damaging projectile or by using a weapon that could attack and kill it before the critter vanishes. Although the Prismatic Lacewing only spawns naturally in worlds where Plantera has been defeated, it is possible to bring one to a Pre-Hardmode world and kill it to summon the boss. Like most critters, the Prismatic Lacewing can be caught with any bug net, and can then be released and killed by the player.

Jellyfish are enemies found in water. When underwater, they attack by propelling themselves towards the player in short bursts. When outside of water, they will be unable to move or pursue the player in any way. Jellyfish are able to jump out of the water to attack players, often leaving them stranded on land. Most varieties of Jellyfish produce light, making them easy to spot in dark areas. There are currently 5 Jellyfish variants, 3 of which only appear during Hardmode. Blue Jellyfish only spawn in pre-Hardmode and are replaced by the Green variant in Hardmode. In Expert Mode, Jellyfish will periodically become electrified, making them invincible for the duration of the attack. If the player attacks a Jellyfish with a sword while it is electrified (or any other swung item that deals direct damage, such as most tools), the player will be hurt. A Jellyfish will constantly maintain its speed while electrified unless it comes into contact with a wall or the water's surface.

Description:
The Dog is a town pet. It arrives at dawn (4:30 AM) the day after the player uses the Dog License, which is purchased from the Zoologist for 5. The Dog does not count towards the NPCs' "crowded" limit and hence will not affect NPC happiness, although it does count as a regular town NPC for the purpose of the Pylon network. There are six breeds of Dog, with one randomly being chosen when it arrives. The only requirements for the Dog to appear is the use of a Dog License and the presence of a valid house. The Dog's house can be changed, as with any other NPC, however the Dog can share the same house as another NPC. The Dog needs a 2-tile floor space to sleep on occasionally; it may not move into a house if that space is not available. The Dog can be talked to with the ⚷ Interact button, like any other town NPC. It will offer a "Pet" option, which places the player directly in front of the Dog when selected, and displays an animation of them petting the Dog, an effect that is a purely visual. It only works if there are at least two flat tiles on the same level as the Dog in front of it. Using any item, taking damage, or closing the dialogue window terminates the animation. Like the Angler, the status message displayed when the Dog is killed is "<name of Dog> has left!". It will respawn within the next days, and may respawn as a different breed. The Town Dog may have any of the following names:

Description:
Mimics are rare Hardmode enemies disguised as chests, appearing as the appropriate chest type for the environment. Mimics can be spawned by the player using the Chest Statue, even prior to Hardmode. However, Mimics spawned this way only drop the Mimic Banner. Mimics can also spawn naturally prior to Hardmode in worlds with the Remix Seed. Rare Hallowed, Corrupt, and Crimson Mimics can also be spawned manually by players via a Key of Light or Key of Night (see the Biome Mimic section below). Ordinary Mimics look like chests until approached or attacked, at which point they come to life and chase the player by hopping towards them. Before revealing themselves, they take on the appearance of chests normally found in the biome they are encountered in: regular Chests above the Underground layer, Gold Chests Underground, and locked Shadow Chests in The Underworld. Mimics that spawn in a Snow biome on ice or snow take on the appearance of Frozen / Ice Chests and also have their own unique set of ice-themed drops. These Mimics are rarer, and much more powerful in every way, than the normal Mimics (they are even more deadly than any pre-Hardmode boss, with the possible exception of the Wall of Flesh). They only spawn in the vicinity of the underground version of their corresponding biome. Each type has its own set of unique drops, including powerful early Hardmode weapons and tools. Like ordinary Mimics, they only spawn in Hardmode worlds. The Jungle variant spawns only in Celebrationmk10 and Get fixed boi worlds. On the Old Chinese version and tModLoader 1.3-Legacy version, it is unimplemented and never spawns during normal gameplay. Similar to ordinary Mimics, these special variants disguise themselves as "Chests" until approached or attacked, but they do not resemble any Chest type currently in the game, and are significantly larger than ordinary Chests. Hallowed, Corrupt, and Crimson Mimics can also be summoned manually by the player, in Hardmode worlds only, by placing a Key of Light or a Key of Night inside an otherwise empty Chest; the Chest becomes a Mimic once it is closed. Note that this does not work using other storage items, such as Dressers. The natural evil biome of the current world determines whether a Corrupt or a Crimson Mimic is summoned via the Key of Night. All four special Mimics have the same attack patterns: The Jungle Mimic has an additional "attack" called the "stuff cannon", which consists of hurling 10 of the following blocks (in "dropped form") at the player: While disguised, Mimics will not show a usual enemy tooltip when hovering the mouse cursor over them. Below are some tips to help differentiate real chests from Mimics.

Description:
Duke Fishron is a Hardmode boss. While he can be summoned as soon as Hardmode is initiated, he can pose a serious threat to new or underprepared players and should be fought later on in the game. Some players may challenge him with post-mechanical bosses gear, but most players may want to wait until post-Golem to battle him. Fighting Duke Fishron is completely optional and not required for game progression, but his defeat will reward the player with powerful weapons. On the Old-gen console version, Windows Phone version, and Nintendo 3DS version, Duke Fishron and Ocram are the final bosses due to the lack of the Moon Lord in these versions. While Duke Fishron is alive, his exclusive music Duke Fishronhttps://terraria.fandom.com/wiki/File:Music-Duke_Fishron.mp3 will play. When Otherworldly music is enabled, the track Boss 2 (Otherworldly)https://terraria.fandom.com/wiki/File:Music-Boss_2_(Otherworldly).mp3 will play instead. On the Old-gen console, Windows Phone, Old Chinese, 3DS, and tModLoader Legacy versions, Boss 1https://terraria.fandom.com/wiki/File:Music-Boss_1.mp3 will play. Duke Fishron is summoned by fishing in the Ocean using a Truffle Worm as bait. The Truffle Worm is a rare critter that must be caught with the Bug Net, Golden Bug Net, or Lavaproof Bug Net in an underground Glowing Mushroom biome. Once the bobber bobs, reeling in the line spawns Duke Fishron, who emerges from the water, pauses for a moment, and then begins attacking the player. Summoning Duke Fishron does not require that any other bosses have been defeated beforehand, so on a technical level, he is only restricted by the Hardmode exclusive Truffle Worm, which can be used to spawn him in any world. If within the Ocean biome, he can also be summoned by fishing in lava or honey. The player's Fishing Power is irrelevant to the summoning, and Crate or Sonar potions will be wasted. When hitting the player in Expert Mode or Master Mode, Duke Fishron has a 33% chance to inflict Bleeding and a 33% chance to inflict Feral Bite. Bleeding can be ignored with an Adhesive Bandage or any of its upgrades, and all of Feral Bite's side effects will be prevented by the Ankh Charm or Ankh Shield. Duke Fishron lunges at the player exactly five times, traveling through blocks, before using one of two projectile attacks in this order: When Duke Fishron falls below 50% (30000 / 39000 / 49500) health, he remains stationary for a second and transforms, being a good time to deal damage and/or consume Potions. His skin becomes a darker green and his eyes will start glowing. His damage and speed increase significantly, but his defense is reduced to 40. His lunges become faster, and are only performed three times instead of five before executing one of his projectile attacks, which are also upgraded: When Duke Fishron falls below 15% (11700 / 14850) health, he will stop moving to transform again, and the background will be covered in a dark, blue fog. Duke Fishron will become invisible, but his eyes still glow. His damage will be reduced to 184 / 277, his defense will drop all the way to 0, and he will only attack by charging at the player, but he gains the ability to teleport behind them before doing so. His charges will come in a set pattern: After being defeated, the background will return to normal, and his Treasure Bag will be dropped.

Hallowed, Corrupt, and Crimson Mimics can also be summoned manually by the player, in Hardmode worlds only, by placing a Key of Light or a Key of Night inside an otherwise empty Chest; the Chest becomes a Mimic once it is closed. Note that this does not work using other storage items, such as Dressers. The natural evil biome of the current world determines whether a Corrupt or a Crimson Mimic is summoned via the Key of Night. All four special Mimics have the same attack patterns: The Jungle Mimic has an additional "attack" called the "stuff cannon", which consists of hurling 10 of the following blocks (in "dropped form") at the player: While disguised, Mimics will not show a usual enemy tooltip when hovering the mouse cursor over them. Below are some tips to help differentiate real chests from Mimics.

Mothron is a powerful flying Enemy that spawns during the Solar Eclipse event and passes through Blocks. It can only spawn after: The Mech Bosses have been defeated, Plantera has been defeated. Mothron attacks by lunging at the player. Occasionally it lands on blocks to lay several Mothron Eggs that will spawn Baby Mothrons if they are not destroyed in time, much like Lepus. On the PC version, Console version, Mobile version, and tModLoader version, it is one of the few entities that can be detected by the Lifeform Analyzer or its upgrades.

Name: Moon Lord
Type: Boss

Stats:
• Environment: Lunar Events
• Damage: (Varies per attack)
• Max Life: 145000217500277311 (total)
• Defense: (Varies per part)
• Knockback Resist: 100%

Behavior:
The Moon Lord has two hands and a head that must be killed before his core becomes available for attack. He positions his two hands on either side of the player some distance away.
Each hand, as well as his head, contains a vulnerable eye-like target that is each periodically closed off and opened via an eyelid. These may only be damaged during their "open" states. The core, which is the only part required to be destroyed in order to defeat the boss, only becomes vulnerable when all eye sockets are destroyed.
The Moon Lord can teleport to players if all of them get too far out of range.

Attacks:
• The Moon Lord's hands move away from the core and their eyes spawn six Phantasmal Spheres. After a couple seconds, they explode, dealing heavy damage. If the player is far enough away, they simultaneously charge at the player before exploding, though they cannot travel at an angle higher than approximately 30 degrees in any direction.
• The hand eyes also spawn multiple Phantasmal Eyes, which move in all directions for a short while before homing in on the player. Like the Phantasmal Spheres, they cannot travel at an upward angle, so they can be evaded by swerving upwards. If they cannot get a direct lock and a player is in range then they will attempt to match the target's trajectory to stay in their path. They explode upon contact with a block or player.
• The hand eyes also occasionally fire two Phantasmal Bolts in quick succession, aiming at the player, which pass through blocks, requiring swerves to avoid. Another viable option is to quickly drop down before the bolts fire, saving the player from getting hit.
• When attached to the Moon Lord's head, the head eye opens every 20–21 seconds for a few seconds, and then fires a Phantasmal Deathray: a large laser that sweeps 60 degrees upward over the player. This is by far Moon Lord's most damaging attack. Afterward, the head eye blinks a couple times, and fires two Phantasmal Bolts (similarly to those of the hands), and then closes. As of 1.4, the Head eye will also fire two Phantasmal Bolts before performing the Deathray attack, the Deathray can pass through solid blocks as well. In the getfixedboi seed, after the Phantasmal Deathray begins, the Moon Lord will eject around 5 Moon Boulders, which bounce about very quickly and over long distances and inflict massive damage upon touching the player. These can be devastating if the player is fighting the Moon Lord close to the ground due to the Moon Boulders bouncing rapidly and unpredictably off blocks.
• After the Deathray attack, the mouth attempts to attach a Tentacle to the player. The Tentacle can reach through solid blocks. Once attached, it spawns multiple Moon Leech Clots, which are enemies that travel from the player to the Moon Lord's mouth. Any Moon Leech Clot that reaches the mouth without being killed returns 1000 health to one of the Moon Lord's parts (one that has not yet been defeated). The Tentacle also inflicts the Moon Bite debuff, preventing any life-steal effects from weapons/armor like Vampire Knives or Spectre Armor for 14 seconds (16 seconds in Expert Mode). Once the Head eye is defeated, the Tentacle attack becomes more common, with only about a 2 second break between attacks.
• When a hand or head target is defeated, it becomes a thorny crevice that deals damage on contact.
• Additionally, when a head or hand target is defeated, a True Eye of Cthulhu spawns, which cycles through the following attacks: The eye fires two Phantasmal Bolts at the player, similar to those from the hand eyes. The eye spawns six Phantasmal Spheres in a hexagonal formation around itself, which after a few seconds will charge directly at the player, dealing a significant amount of damage to the player. This is by far the dominant source of damage in the second phase and should be avoided by swerving/dashing. The eye spawns Phantasmal Eyes, which behave similarly to when before the eyes were defeated. The eye charges and fires a lesser Phantasmal Deathray, smaller and dealing significantly less damage. Unlike the primary laser, these attacks cannot go through blocks. Finally, the eye performs another Phantasmal Sphere attack.
• The True Eyes of Cthulhu are invincible and will only despawn if either all players die or the Moon Lord is defeated. The eyes remain stationary for most of their attacks.
• The Moon Lord will teleport to the nearest player in a blinding flash if the player he is targeting dies or moves more than 150 tiles away.[2]

Description:
The Moon Lord is a Hardmode, post-Lunatic Cultist boss. He is the final boss of the PC, Console, Mobile, Old Chinese, tModLoader, and tModLoader Legacy versions of Terraria. The Moon Lord can be spawned by destroying the four Celestial Pillars or by using a Celestial Sigil in any world where Golem has been defeated. He will then spawn one minute after the status message "Impending doom approaches..." appears, or 12 seconds if spawned using the Celestial Sigil. After this message appears, the screen will go dim, the music will gradually become quieter until it goes silent, and all objects and walls will oscillate back and forth. It will then go back to normal. This will happen 5 times; each time the screen will go darker and all objects and walls will oscillate more violently until the 5th time, when Moon Lord will spawn. See below for the Moon Bite debuff inflicted by the Moon Lord. While Moon Lord is alive, his exclusive music Moon Lordhttps://terraria.fandom.com/wiki/File:Music-Moon_Lord.mp3 will play. When Otherworldly music is enabled, the track Lunar Boss (Otherworldly)https://terraria.fandom.com/wiki/File:Music-Lunar_Boss_(Otherworldly).mp3 will play instead.

Name: Mimics
Type: Enemy

Stats:

Description:
Mimics are rare Hardmode enemies disguised as chests, appearing as the appropriate chest type for the environment. Mimics can be spawned by the player using the Chest Statue, even prior to Hardmode. However, Mimics spawned this way only drop the Mimic Banner. Mimics can also spawn naturally prior to Hardmode in worlds with the Remix Seed. Rare Hallowed, Corrupt, and Crimson Mimics can also be spawned manually by players via a Key of Light or Key of Night (see the Biome Mimic section below). Ordinary Mimics look like chests until approached or attacked, at which point they come to life and chase the player by hopping towards them. Before revealing themselves, they take on the appearance of chests normally found in the biome they are encountered in: regular Chests above the Underground layer, Gold Chests Underground, and locked Shadow Chests in The Underworld. Mimics that spawn in a Snow biome on ice or snow take on the appearance of Frozen / Ice Chests and also have their own unique set of ice-themed drops. These Mimics are rarer, and much more powerful in every way, than the normal Mimics (they are even more deadly than any pre-Hardmode boss, with the possible exception of the Wall of Flesh). They only spawn in the vicinity of the underground version of their corresponding biome. Each type has its own set of unique drops, including powerful early Hardmode weapons and tools. Like ordinary Mimics, they only spawn in Hardmode worlds. The Jungle variant spawns only in Celebrationmk10 and Get fixed boi worlds. On the Old Chinese version and tModLoader 1.3-Legacy version, it is unimplemented and never spawns during normal gameplay. Similar to ordinary Mimics, these special variants disguise themselves as "Chests" until approached or attacked, but they do not resemble any Chest type currently in the game, and are significantly larger than ordinary Chests. Hallowed, Corrupt, and Crimson Mimics can also be summoned manually by the player, in Hardmode worlds only, by placing a Key of Light or a Key of Night inside an otherwise empty Chest; the Chest becomes a Mimic once it is closed.

Description:
Jellyfish are enemies found in water. When underwater, they attack by propelling themselves towards the player in short bursts. When outside of water, they will be unable to move or pursue the player in any way. Jellyfish are able to jump out of the water to attack players, often leaving them stranded on land. Most varieties of Jellyfish produce light, making them easy to spot in dark areas. There are currently 5 Jellyfish variants, 3 of which only appear during Hardmode. Blue Jellyfish only spawn in pre-Hardmode and are replaced by the Green variant in Hardmode. In Expert Mode, Jellyfish will periodically become electrified, making them invincible for the duration of the attack. If the player attacks a Jellyfish with a sword while it is electrified (or any other swung item that deals direct damage, such as most tools), the player will be hurt. A Jellyfish will constantly maintain its speed while electrified unless it comes into contact with a wall or the water's surface.

The Party Girl is a pre-Hardmode NPC vendor who sells festive novelty items and furniture. Unlike most other town NPCs, the Party Girl has a random 2.5*1/40 (2.5%) chance to spawn every morning and evening once the criteria below are met, rather than being guaranteed to appear once fulfilling them. This random chance also applies to her respawning following her death. Said criteria require that: On the PC version, Console version, Mobile version, Old Chinese version, tModLoader version, and tModLoader 1.3-Legacy version, the Party Girl will defend herself against nearby enemies by throwing Happy Grenades at them, dealing 30 / 45 / 52 damage at the start of the game, and (on the PC version, Console version, Mobile version, and tModLoader version) as players progress she will gain various stat increases.[1] She will also occasionally throw confetti at the player. Sometimes she may drop a large quantity of Happy Grenades upon her death. On the PC version, Console version, Mobile version, and tModLoader version, when talked to during a natural Party, she will give the first player to talk to her a Slice of Cake. After the world with seed 05162020 is visited, the game unlocks the option to toggle the game's default soundtrack for the Terraria: Otherworld soundtrack, by selecting the "Music" option through the Party Girl. Once unlocked, the option carries across all players and all worlds. Every song in Terraria's soundtrack is replaced, and those that do not have a Terraria: Otherworld equivalent will use the most relevant song; for example, the Underground Jungle will simply use Terraria: Otherworld's Jungle theme, rather than Terraria's Underground Jungle theme. On a multiplayer world, players only hear the altered soundtrack if they have used the "Music" option themselves, which is only present for those who have visited seed 05162020. However, Otherworld music boxes are listenable for all players on multiplayer worlds, regardless of whether they've toggled the option before. Every new song has its own unique Music Box, all of which are called "Otherworldly Music Boxes". Upon leaving the world, the soundtrack will revert to the default. For more information, see NPC happiness. When submerged in Shimmer, the Party Girl will transform into her Shimmered form. This has no impact on gameplay or dialogue and is only a visual change. She can be returned to her classic look by submerging her in Shimmer again. The Party Girl may have any of the following names:

It appears as a large tripod enemy that moves at a very fast pace, and has the ability to fire blue lasers at the player, with a maximum fire rate of once every 0.12 seconds (7 ticks[1]) or 8.5 shots per second.[2] These traits combined with its amount of health and its resistance against knockback can make this enemy somewhat difficult to defeat.

Stats:
• Damage: 10

• Knockback Resist: 50%

Drops:
• Peddler's Hat100%

Description:
The Traveling Merchant is a unique NPC vendor who randomly visits the player's town for one day. His inventory is randomized and different every visit, selling 4–10 / 4–12 (average 5.47 / 5.97; see below for details) different items listed below. This amount is increased by 2 on Celebrationmk10 worlds, and by 1 by using the Peddler's Satchel. In order for the Traveling Merchant to spawn, at least 2 other NPCs must already be present. The Guide counts as one of these, but the Old Man and Skeleton Merchant do not[1]. He will not spawn during Solar Eclipses, the Goblin Army, Frost Legion, Pirate Invasion, Martian Madness[2] or if the chat is open. He does not require his own house in order to spawn, and will instead spawn next to NPCs, including town pets, spending the day walking around them. Once the criteria are met, the Traveling Merchant has a 22.12% chance of spawning each day, appearing at a random time between 4:30 AM and 12:00 PM. The chances of him spawning are always the same regardless if the player is sleeping. He leaves the same day at 6:00 PM, but can only do so once he is off-screen. He despawns if the world is vacated any time after he spawns. If threatened by enemies, the Traveling Merchant will defend himself with a Revolver. Once Hardmode begins, he upgrades to a Pulse Bow. Due to elaborate randomizer functions and dependencies upon several variables, it is nearly impossible to state an exact chance of an item being sold by the Traveling Merchant.[3] However, it is possible to group them in six rarity "slots", ranging from "Common" to "Extraordinarily Rare". Note that these slots do not correspond to the Traveling Merchant's shop inventory slots – all sold items may be from only one slot. They are only meant to provide a rough, comparative estimate of an item's rarity. Each shop slot will roll a 1/n chance of being for every possible item where n is 100 × the rarity slot. This chance is affected by the luckiest player currently in the world. Items that are always selected when another item is selected don't have their own chance being selected. All colored team blocks share the same chance of getting selected; if the chance succeeds, the color is randomly chosen. When multiple items pass this chance, the item that was tested, the latest will be the selected. Within the slots, items higher in the list below have a marginally higher chance of being sold, e.g., the Companion Cube is sold slightly more often than the Water Gun (on average), because it is higher in the list. The Traveling Merchant sells exactly one painting and has guaranteed slot for it. The following tables list the chances of the numbers of items sold by the Traveling Merchant.[4] Only "base" items are counted, i.e., Dynasty Shingles and Team Platforms are excluded from this number, since they are always sold together with their "base" items Dynasty Wood or Team Block, respectively. The selected amount is increased by 2 on Celebrationmk10 worlds. These chances reveal that the average number of sold "base" items is 5.47 / 5.97. When submerged in Shimmer, the Traveling Merchant will transform into his Shimmered form. This has no impact on gameplay or dialogue and is only a visual change. He can be returned to his classic look by submerging him in Shimmer again. The Traveling Merchant may have any of the following names:

Description:
The Lunatic Cultist is a Hardmode, post-Golem boss summoned by killing the Cultists that spawn at the Dungeon's entrance after Golem is defeated. Defeating the Lunatic Cultist initiates the Lunar Events. After all four Celestial Pillars have been destroyed, The Moon Lord will spawn and the Cultists will respawn at the Dungeon entrance, allowing the player to fight the Lunatic Cultist and initiate the Lunar Events again. Unlike most bosses, the Lunatic Cultist does not drop any weapons; however, it does drop the Ancient Manipulator, a placeable item that is used to craft many endgame items. While the Lunatic Cultist is alive, the music Golemhttps://terraria.fandom.com/wiki/File:Music-Golem.mp3 will play. When Otherworldly music is enabled, the track Boss 2 (Otherworldly)https://terraria.fandom.com/wiki/File:Music-Boss_2_(Otherworldly).mp3 will play instead.

Description:
A Harpy is a flying enemy that spawns at high altitudes, typically around Floating Island heights. Prior to Hardmode, they cannot spawn in the vertical section of the map centered around the player's spawn point being around one-tenth of the width of the entire map. This restriction is removed in Hardmode. They move following the Bat AI, and fire feather projectiles in inaccurate bursts of three. Up to seven Harpies can exist on screen during the day, ten at night, and fifteen during a Blood Moon.
