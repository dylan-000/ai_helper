Terraria has no formal player class or leveling system. However, weapons can be grouped into four distinct categories based on their damage type – melee, ranged, magic, and summoning. In general, it is recommended to focus on one class, as many armors, accessories, and buffs only benefit a specific class, especially later into the game. This page lists every combat item in the game, from weakest to strongest, providing a comprehensive overview of your in-game progression. 

Melee 

The melee class utilizes weapons such as swords, spears, and yoyos. Many melee weapons have a short attack range, and those that are viable at a distance tend to do lower damage than their close-range counterparts. 

Ranged 

Rangers are able to attack from a distance, utilizing weapons like bows and guns, as well as thrown objects. Unless using the Endless Quiver or Endless Musket Pouch, ranged users must constantly acquire ammunition. This can be done through crafting or purchasing from the Arms Dealer. 

Magic 

Magicians are highly varied in attack style, often utilizing special mechanics such as homing, lifesteal, and area-of-effect damage. They are held back by reliance on mana, which regenerates very slowly unless the Mana Regeneration buff is in effect. Magic-users must use mana potions if they wish to recover mana instantly. 

Summoning 

Summoners focus on increasing the number and strength of summonable minions. Whips are primary weapons that will focus summons and increase their damage. While it is possible to beat the game with only summon damage, the summoning class was balanced around the idea of the player also using weapons from other classes in addition to minions and whips. 





Pre-Bosses
Before encountering a boss, armor sets from wooden and ore materials primarily provide additional defense. Accessories do not typically discriminate by weapon type, and with limited weapon variety and the need for survival, sticking to a "class" is not crucial early on. Players are encouraged to use whatever resources they can gather. It is possible to acquire a gun or magic weapon early by smashing a Corruption or Crimson Orb.

Pre-Hardmode
Once you begin defeating the first bosses, new options become available, and you should have enough mana to use magic weapons. However, the armors still offer small bonuses, allowing you to mix class styles without significant loss of damage. Dedicated summoners are still weak at this point, although their summoning items can be used by any class. On the PC, Console, Mobile, and tModLoader versions, with the addition of Obsidian armor and Spinal Tap, Summoners become much more powerful than in earlier versions of the game.

Pre-Mechanical Bosses
At this point in the game, it becomes almost mandatory to pick a specific class. Many accessories will only benefit a certain class, and armor sets start to benefit only certain types of damage. However, summoner hybridization remains viable and extremely potent due to the availability of the powerful Sanguine Staff. This is also when you may want to start focusing on getting good modifiers for your equipment.

Pre-Plantera
At this stage in the game, mixed classes become weaker compared to focusing on a single class, mainly due to separate armor sets designed for each class. You can still play a mixed class, but it’s recommended to keep a backup armor set (such as in the vanity slots) to quickly switch for additional damage or defense. Hallowed armor may be preferred for extra survivability. Buffs are extremely useful for bosses and are almost necessary in master mode.

Pre-Plantera: Summoning
