# Starting Out

When creating a new world, a helpful NPC called the **Guide** will spawn. If you’re new, speak with him to get advice based on your progress. Even experienced players benefit from his presence, as he displays all available crafting recipes when given an item. He is also essential later for summoning the Wall of Flesh.

# Beginner Strategy

1. **Gather Resources & Build a House**  
   - Cut down trees with your Copper Axe (aim for the lowest block) to gather wood.  
   - Build a Work Bench.  
   - Craft a Wooden Sword and perhaps a Wooden Bow (with Wooden Arrows, which can later be upgraded to Flaming Arrows).

2. **Journey Mode Exception (1.4.0.1-exclusive)**  
   - Start with better equipment:
     - Iron starting tools  
     - Finch Staff (weak early summon weapon)  
     - 100 Rope and Torches  
     - Fledgling Wings  
     - Grappling Hook  
     - Magic Mirror  
   - Includes additional gameplay powers like time control and item duplication.

3. **Explore Your Surroundings**  
   - Look for Chests and Pots near your starting point.  
   - There is a 9% chance per chest to find a Spear – effective against Zombies.  
   - Collect 20 Cobwebs to craft a Wooden Yoyo, a useful starter weapon.  
   - Locate a cave entrance (a domed hill with an opening) for Underground exploration.
   - Use Rope and Platforms to navigate high ledges, bridge gaps, and safely descend.
   - The Step Stool accessory (found in chests) increases block placing range and jump height.
   - The Umbrella tool (usable as a weapon on multiple versions) slows your fall during exploration.

4. **Head Underground Before Night Falls**  
   - Collect bars (Iron or Lead) from surface chests and small ore pockets.  
   - Craft an Iron Anvil and basic ore weapons to ease further adventuring.

- **Unique Music:** Specific to biomes like the Jungle, Ocean, and Space.
  
**Additional Night Events (PC, Console, Mobile, tModLoader)**  
- **Meteor Shower:** 1 in 10 chance; increases Fallen Star rates and spawns Enchanted Nightcrawler critters.
- **Lantern Nights:** Occur after defeating a boss or event, increasing player Luck.

**Strategy for Nighttime**  
- It is best to remain Underground or inside your house until you’re strong enough to handle Zombie packs.
- If caught outside without shelter, build a small box with two-block-wide openings to safely attack Zombies without being reached.
- Use blocks to navigate or build defensive structures.

**Fallen Stars Usage**  
- Useful for crafting and dealing damage to enemies or bosses.
- Can be used to craft a Mana Crystal (increases maximum mana by 20, up to a base maximum of 200) or turned into Jester's Arrows (which pierce, have extra knockback, and are gravity-defiant).

**Other Weapons and Drops**  
- **Spear:** Occasionally found in chests; effective against groups of Zombies.  
- **Wooden Boomerang:** Can be upgraded into an Enchanted Boomerang (available on select versions) when combined with a Fallen Star.
- **Mob Drops:**  
  - Zombies have a 2% chance to drop the Shackle (adds +1 defense).  
  - Zombies may also drop the Zombie Arm (comparable to the Tungsten Broadsword).  
  - Demon Eyes drop Lens, and rarely the Black Lens, which becomes useful later.

**Sunrise**  
- Occurs at 4:30 AM, ending Night.  
- Demon Eyes and Zombies flee, allowing for daytime exploration and cave entry for more loot.

# Building a Base

**Walkthrough Base**

- **Overview:**  
  Once you’ve collected plenty of blocks and loot, consider building a base. It may take anywhere from one in-game day to more than a week, depending on your style. You don’t need to finish it all at once—you can expand later using the surplus blocks from mining.

  - **NPC Housing:** Build valid houses for the Guide, Merchant, and Nurse (plus extra for future NPCs).  
  - **Storage:** Organize several chests to keep your inventory uncluttered.

  - **Crafting Room:**

    - Arrange a Chair and Table together for crafting Watches.

# The Bosses: Dealing with the First Three

After surviving the first few nights and starting work on your base, begin preparing for boss battles. Even if you don’t seek them out, bosses will eventually come looking for you.

---

## King Slime

- **Overview:**  
  - An optional but fun mini-boss whose drops aren’t necessary for game progression.
  - Can spawn rarely in grass at the outer sixth of the world, via a Slime Crown, or during a Slime Rain (if 150 slimes are killed).
  - Spawn chance increases near a placed Water Candle or under the effects of a Battle Potion.

- **Tactics & Rewards:**  
  - A good challenge for beginners; terrain can be used to your advantage.
  - **Key Drops:**  
    - **Slime Hook:** Superior to any hook available at this stage.
    - **Ninja Hood (PC/Console/Mobile/tModLoader):** Grants critical hit bonuses (except for summoning weapons).

---

## Eye of Cthulhu

- **Overview:**  
  - Appears as an enormous Demon Eye that moves through blocks and has two forms.
  - **First Form:**  
    - Floats near the player while spawning Servants of Cthulhu (which drop hearts and stars on death).
  - **Second Form (below half health):**  
    - Charges aggressively, stops spawning Servants, and has reduced defense.
  - **Expert Mode Variations:**  
    - Increased health, earlier transition into the second form, and a rapid charge attack that speeds up as its health declines.

---

## Eater of Worlds or Brain of Cthulhu

After defeating the Eye of Cthulhu, complete these steps:
  
- **Preparation:**  
  - Ensure the Dryad has a home (she sells Purification Powder and planters).
  - Build at least 12 valid NPC houses (preferably linked by Pylons for easy access).
  - Start your plant farm for essential potions.
  - Set up a chest room for ample storage.

- **Next Step:**  
  - Head to the Corruption or Crimson and smash a Shadow Orb or Crimson Heart. Smashing your first orb/heart has two immediate effects:
  
  ### Mini Biome: Meteorite
  - **Chance:** 50% on breaking a Shadow Orb or Crimson Heart (only once per day; additional breaks do not stack chance).
  - **When:** May land immediately between midnight and dawn (04:30).
  - **Precondition:** In PC/Console/Mobile/tModLoader, meteorites only fall after defeating Eater of Worlds/Brain of Cthulhu.
  
  - **Recommended Setup:**  
    - **Life:** 200  
    - **Weaponry:** Vilethorn  
    - **Armor:** Silver/Tungsten set  
    - **Equipment:** Dynamite, Sticky Bombs, Gold or Platinum Pickaxe, buff potions
  
  - **Challenges:**  
    - Mining is tough due to Meteor Heads that cause burning damage.
    - An Obsidian Skull can prevent this burn.
    - Using Dynamite over platforms and sticky bombs can help clear the meteorite area.
    - Killing 50 Meteor Heads can yield their banner, easing further encounters.

---

## Event: Goblin Army

# Preparing For Hardmode

At this stage you’re in control—with ample resources and no immediate threats. It’s an ideal time to work on large projects such as arenas, bases, or farms. Keep in mind that depending on your base’s location, it might end up in an infected biome. You’ll also need to gather certain materials in pre-Hardmode since farming becomes much easier before Hardmode begins.
