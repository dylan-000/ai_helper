Potions
Potions are consumable items that recover the user's health and/or mana either instantaneously or over time, or grant temporary buffs or debuffs. They are commonly found in natural chests and Pots, dropped by enemies, purchased from NPCs, or crafted. Most potions can be crafted at a Placed Bottle or Alchemy Table, while flasks must be crafted at an Imbuing Station.

Potion Buffs
Potion buffs can be canceled at any time by:

Right-clicking the buff icon (PC version)

Selecting the buff icon and canceling it in the equipment menu (Nintendo Switch, Old-gen console version)

Selecting the buff with Left Shoulder Button + X/B then canceling the buff with A (Console version)

Double-tapping the buff icon (Mobile version)

Canceling the buff from the buffs screen (Nintendo 3DS version)

All potion buffs (including food buffs) are lost upon dying or when leaving and rejoining the world. However, as of version 1.4.4, flasks remain active.

Journey Mode
In Journey Mode, all potions require 20 research to unlock duplication, but 30 research is needed for recovery potions.
